	WARNING !! WARNING !! WARNING !! WARNING !! WARNING !! WARNING !! WARNING !!

	Inbound file handling is changed, this version is under test and should NOT
	be used on production systems if you don't want to help debugging.
	Handshake and EMSI is changed, please run this version with debugging on,
	mbsetup 1.14.1 turn 5, 11 and 18 on at least. Report any problems and include
	a piece of the logfile.

	Before installing, make a copy of /opt/mbse/bin/mbcico so you can go back
	if you experience any problems.

	As far as I have tested, there should be no problems with this version.

	WARNING !! WARNING !! WARNING !! WARNING !! WARNING !! WARNING !! WARNING !!

	WARNING, users of Sparc and HP-PA systems should be carefull, some bbs
	menus do not work. All other programs do work on all platforms.
	All other users on Intel machines (99,9% I think) can use this version.

v0.37.6		10-Aug-2003

	general:
		Changed all Linux references into GNU/Linux.
		Changed the address of the FSF in all sources.
		Removed memwatch debugger.
		Changed all gif and jpg images to png images.
		Added a setup switch for the nodes for selecting the wrong
		binkp long filenames escape method for Argus and Irex nodes.
		Activated the productcode for mbse that is published in the
		ftscprod.007
		Changed the website address in several sources.

	nodelist.a:
		Removed some of the debug logging.

	mbcico:
		Completly changed the files inbound receive, all files are now
		first stored in a unique per node temporary inbound directory.

		to the final inbound directory. Hopefully this will solve the
		resync problems.

		systems.

		is selectable in the nodes setup.
		A light improvement in session handshake setup timers.
		Added EMSI handshake timers, this gives a more relaxed EMSI
		handshake.
		Set the EMSI receive failure count to 20 instead of 6, we can
		now even accept buggy maindoor sessions and still display a
		banner.
		For FTS-0001 sessions the mail password was used instead of the
		session password. Also improved the password check.
		The product code was not entered in the FTS-0001 packet headers.

	mbsetup:
		In the nodes setup a switch is added to fallback to the wrong
		binkp escape method.

		reopend to /dev/null.
		Zero the daily status counters finally works again.

		which indicates your TCP/IP capabilities. This is only for
		systems that use TCP/IP, dialup systems should only have
		the XX,CM flags. Important: only protocols that you place
		in this entry are supported, so XX,CM,IBN will let your system
		only call binkp nodes.

	general:
		A new developer/translator joined the team, David Gonzalez.
		The settings to suppres some IP protocols (global and nodes)
		are removed, this behaviour must be set using nodelist flags 
		configuration.

		Nodelist debug logging now uses the N character.
		In some makefiles the chown user.group syntax changed to
		user:group to follow the new POSIX syntax. Please let me know

		this. This was needed for FreeBSD 4.7.
		Added Dutch template macro files. Updated English and German
		template macro files. Please remove old ones before installing.

	libs:
		The nodelist lookup functions are now in a separate library.
		This will give us easy implemtation of new nodelist formats
		and flags.
		Introduced a new file, ~/etc/nodelist.conf, this file will
		be used for nodelist lookup behaviour.
		The current looked-up nodelist strcuture has an extra field,
		the URL how that node must be contacted.

	mbcico:
		With binkp and EMSI sessions double received remote aka's are
		filtered.
		When calling ITN nodes, the default port is now 23.

		At zonegates, the seenby lines were twice stripped.
		Another patch to compensate for sysops that pack pascalnet
		files in fidonet packets and send these messages into the world
		without zone information.
		Made the incoming tic files complete case insensitive, mixed
		case is now processed. If such file is received, the LFN will
		be set to that name.
		The magic unpack command now uses the mail unpack command
		instead of file unpack command so that paths in the archive are
		junked.

	mbsebbs:
		Changed to use the new nodelist lookup methods.

	mbsetup:
		Removed global flags No-IBN, IFC and ITN from the setup.
		Removed nodes flags No-IBN, IFC and ITN from the setup.
