v1.0.6.9	28-Sep-2016 - Andrew Leary

		1.  Fixed compiler warnings while building the BBS.  Thanks to
		Ken Bowley for the patches.

		2.  Fixed a bug with the use of an external editor, and removed
		a limitation that forced a message to have at least two lines.
		Thanks to Ken Bowley for these patches as well.

v1.0.6.8	20-Jul-2016 - Andrew Leary

		1.  Fixed the SETUP.sh script to handle installing on fresh
		installations of Ubuntu 12.04+.  These versions do not install
		an admin group, which MBSE uses to enable the mbse user to run
		sudo.  SETUP.sh will now add the admin group if it doesn't
		exist, to prevent useradd failing to create the mbse user.
		This change only affects first time installations on Ubuntu
		12.04 or later.

v1.0.6.7	28-Jun-2016 - Andrew Leary

		1.  Added the ability to disable cross-zone SEEN-BY
		stripping to mbfido.  This is currently a global toggle,
		defaulting to strip SEEN-BYs when crossing zone boundaries. 
		In situations where this behavior is not desired, toggle the
		SBstrip option to "No" in mbsetup 1.11.20.  If there is
		enough call for it, I will consider making this configurable
		on a group and/or area basis.

v1.0.6.6	23-Jun-2016 - Andrew Leary

		1.  Several spelling and grammar corrections in mbsebbs.c,
		chat.c, offline.c, and newuser.c.  Thanks to Sean Dennis for
		the updates.

v1.0.6.5	12-Feb-2016 - Robert James Clay

		1. Edit README file to better reflect current practice.

v1.0.6.4	22-Nov-2015 - Andrew Leary

		1. Updated mbfido's .tic file support to use "Lfile" instead
		of "Fullname" when creating .tic files.  This is to increase
		compatibility with HTick, and comply with the recently
		released FSP-1039.  Both keywords will be accepted in
		incoming .tic files.

v1.0.6.3	05-Nov-2015 - Robert James Clay

		1. Update the Dev Team information in the AUTHORS file.

		03-Nov-2015 - Vincent Coen

		1. Add mbse-1.odt to the docs directory.

v1.0.6.2	17-Oct-2015 - Vincent Coen

		1. Amended mbmon.c and mbsetup.c to reflect new hosting
		for the sources etc at www.sourceforge.net.
		2. Other very minor cosmetics.
		3. Add mbse-1.pdf to a new docs directory.

v1.0.6.1	07-Aug-2015 - Andrew Leary

		1.  Removed the Precise field from Via lines in netmail, as
		it was not actually accurate anyway.  Forwarded netmails had
		this field set to .00, and locally generated netmails had this
		field set to .01.  This field is optional in FTS-4009, but
		if used is supposed to indicate fractions of a second.

v1.0.6		03-Aug-2015 - Andrew Leary

		1.  Added support for specifying a literal IPv6 address
		encased in square brackets for a node.  Previously, IPv6 was
		only supported for nodes having an AAAA record for their
		hostname in DNS.
		2.  The BBS now allows alphanumeric and punctuation
		characters in user passwords.  Previously, only alphanumeric
		characters were permitted.  
		3.  Several minor grammar and punctuation corrections.

v1.0.5          02-Nov-2014 - Andrew Leary (Never officially released)

		1.  Adjusted mbcico's .flo file logic to support a space
		character as the first character of the .flo file line. 
		This character indicates that the file named in the
		remainder of the line should be sent to the remote system. 
		This is needed to allow transmitting filenames that start
		with .flo file reserved characters such as ^, #, -, or @.
		2.  Worked on increasing reliability of Binkp NR mode.  It
		is strongly recommended that CRC mode be enabled for any
		node which NR mode is enabled for.

v1.0.4		03-Sep-2014 - Andrew Leary

		1. Reverted Vince Coen's packaging changes until an upgrade
		script can be written and tested.
		2. Added Binkp CRC support (FSP-1020) to mbcico.
		3. Changed the No Binkp/1.1 setting for nodes to be
		effective on outbound calls only.  It was causing issues
		with other mailers (including BinkD) on inbound calls,
		because mbcico was reporting binkp/1.1 in the VER string and
		then downshifting to binkp/1.0.
		4. Updated the Internet Rex binkp/1.1 bug workaround to
		reflect that versions 2.31 and 2.67 are also affected.

v1.0.3		13-Jun-2014 - Vincent Coen

		1. Changed unix/mbuseradd.c
		Added extra arg to useradd -p 12345 to avoid a locked
		record under Mageia v4 that prevents the password
		adding a record due to a file busy may be: Lets see.
		No it is not so reverted back.

		2. Still looking for cause of bug.

v1.0.2		14-Mar-2014 - Vincent Coen

		Changed packaging to use /home/mbse instead of /opt/mbse
		to suit users with a seperate / and a /home partitions.

		IT DOES NOT CHANGE THE RESULTS FOR AN EXISTING INSTALL
		WHERE mbse & bbs users are set up to use /opt/mbse.

		YOU WILL HAVE TO DO THIS MANUALLY.
		The supplied INSTALL script has been changed.
		
		To do this you will need to change:
		1. Users mbse, bbs and all bbs users to reflect the change
		   of home directory from /opt/mbse to /home/mbse using your 
		   distro's graphic system editing tool for users or if not 
		   available use usermod via sudo etc:
		   usermod -m -d /home/mbse mbse
		   usermod -m -d /home/mbse/home/bbs bbs
		   usermod -m -d /home/mbse/home/user-name bbs user-name
		   
		   Note that the '-m' option in usermod option is to move the
		   contents from the existing to the new location.
		  
		   You can see the list of bbs users by running:
		   ls -la /opt/mbse/home
		   

		2. Using your favourite editor Change 
		   /etc/services  and
		   /etc/xinetd.d/mbsebbs

		   Replacing all instances of /opt/mbse  with
		   			      /home/mbse

		3. Now do the same with http and ftp config files in
		   /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf and
		   /etc/proftpd/proftpd.conf (or whatever ftp & web service
		   you use.

		4. Having installed/upgraded the mbse system you must
		   reboot the system or stop and start mbse, xinetd, ftp,
		   httpd etc
		   services. It is easier just shuting down and starting
		   the system.

		5. As su run cp -ap /opt/mbse /home

		6. If not already done so, build the system using the usual
		   ./configure & make and now run make install as su or if
		   not available do, sudo bash then su then make install

		7. Change all crontab processes that deal with mbse both as
		   user mbse and root to reflect new directory using:
		   crontab -l to see what is current and then as crontab -e
		   to edit.

		8. After rebooting the system check everything is working
		   Then I would suggest renaming /opt/mbse say from /opt/mbse
		   /opt/old-mbse and leave it a few days before deleting when
		   you are SURE that all is working.

		9. Now when you change the /boot partition or install a new
		   version of your distro you can continue to use your /home
		   as is but do not forget to recreate the crontab, xinetd, 
		   rc.d/init.d/mbseb etc as needed by using cp -vp from the
		   old partition to the new or failing that create a modified
		   version of SETUP.sh as needed and run it.
