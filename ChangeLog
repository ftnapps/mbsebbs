        upgrade:
                Start mbsetup once and leave, this will update user records
                with the wrong editor choice, fixes the files databases if
		needed and upgrades the nodes settings.
                Add extra switches to unarchiver commands entry 11, see
                mbsetup for the archivers.
                In menus 7.n.3.14 check if the NR flag is off, unless you need
                it (which I doubt).

                Made OLR bluewave packets CPU independant.
                Fixed a strange bug that ftell didn't work right, this caused
                corrupt bluewave download packets.
                Bluewave is now big/little endian correct.
                Added width marker for chat input and fixed linelength.

                joe editor can use that.
                Changed zmodem transmitter timeout to 60 seconds and changed
                the zmodem init fase so that clients that don't start automatic
                have a chance to start the transfer.
