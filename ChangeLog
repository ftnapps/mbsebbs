v0.37.01	14-Jan-2003.

	general:
		This version may be used on production systems, but be 
		carefull and check your logs.
		Spanish templates and macros added to the examples.
		In several messages handling functions the international 
		charset translations are removed because of several bugs. They
		will be replaced by standard library functions. Right now the
		messages are 8 bit clean and there is no translation on the
		gateway.

	nodelist.a:
		Added experimental support for IP nodes lookup using a default
		domain method. This is not the final implementation yet!

	common.a:
		Removed charset conversion/translation.

	mbtask:
		Arcmail for non-CM nodes and Txx nodes is now sent during the
		node's opening hours or ZMH.
		Fixed a bug where one of the nodelists was node closed with
		each outbound scan and was causing mbtask to stop functioning
		after a few days.
		After forking the daemon, the stdin, stdout and stderr are
		reopend to /dev/null.
		Zero the daily status counters finally works again.

	mbfile:
		In the import function several bugfixes for reading files.bbs.
		Fixed upper/lowercase filenames bug with import.

	mbfido:
		Removed all code for charset translation.

	mbsetup:
		Added protection against wrong database sizes depending on
		global settings.
		When moving a message area to area zero mbsetup doesn't crash
		anymore.

	mbsebbs:
		It will now refuse to up/download OLR packets when the system
		bbs id is not set in the global setup.


v0.37.00	26-Dec-2002 - 14-Jan-2003

	upgrade:
		In mbsetup 1.17.3 check if you have the XX,CM,IBN,IFC flags,
		which indicates your TCP/IP capabilities. This is only for
		systems that use TCP/IP, dialup systems should only have
		the XX,CM flags. Important: only protocols that you place
		in this entry are supported, so XX,CM,IBN will let your system
		only call binkp nodes.

	general:
		A new developer/translator joined the team, David Gonzalez.
		The settings to suppres some IP protocols (global and nodes)
		are removed, this behaviour must be set using nodelist flags 
		configuration.
		Debug logging for mail and news now have one setting, the M.
		Nodelist debug logging now uses the N character.
		In some makefiles the chown user.group syntax changed to
		user:group to follow the new POSIX syntax. Please let me know
		if you are using an older distribution that complains about
		this. This was needed for FreeBSD 4.7.
		Added Dutch template macro files. Updated English and German
		template macro files. Please remove old ones before installing.

	libs:
		The nodelist lookup functions are now in a separate library.
		This will give us easy implemtation of new nodelist formats
		and flags.
		Introduced a new file, ~/etc/nodelist.conf, this file will
		be used for nodelist lookup behaviour.
		The current looked-up nodelist strcuture has an extra field,
		the URL how that node must be contacted.

	mbcico:
		With binkp and EMSI sessions double received remote aka's are
		filtered.
		When calling ITN nodes, the default port is now 23.
		Call setup changed and uses now the nodelist lookup URL.
		Changed raw ifcico debug logging.

	mbout:
		When a poll was removed, the outbound was not rescanned.

	examples:
		Prepared for more example translations.
		Added German template files made by Joachim Kuwan.

	script:
		Added new init script for FreeBSD.

	mbfile:
		Move old files to another area failed, only the symbolic link
		was moved.
		Prepared for multilanguage html pages creation.

	mbfido:
		Echomail from other zones showed the address of your own zone.
		Added logging when other errors are found.
		At zonegates, the seenby lines were twice stripped.
		Another patch to compensate for sysops that pack pascalnet
		files in fidonet packets and send these messages into the world
		without zone information.
		Made the incoming tic files complete case insensitive, mixed
		case is now processed. If such file is received, the LFN will
		be set to that name.
		The magic unpack command now uses the mail unpack command
		instead of file unpack command so that paths in the archive are
		junked.

	mbsebbs:
		Changed to use the new nodelist lookup methods.

	mbsetup:
		Removed global flags No-IBN, IFC and ITN from the setup.
		Removed nodes flags No-IBN, IFC and ITN from the setup.
		removed del/rubout/bs keys logging.

	SETUP.sh
		Made the script more portable.

	CRON.sh
		Removed explanation about Zone Mail Hour, this is obsolete
		for a long time already.


v0.36.00	26-Dec-2002 - stable release

	update:
		These are the total update instructions for the upgrade from
		v0.33.21 until v0.36.00. Read and perform this upgrade with 
		great care, this one is quite complicated.
                Make sure you don't have download files with case differences
                in download directories like FileName.zip and FILENAME.ZIP.
                With this upgrade files with such names will be deleted!
                Rename them before you upgrade!
		Make sure your outbound is empty, "mbout stat" should not show
		anything in the outbounds. You may delete ~/bin/mbfido before
		you do this so when you deliver all pending mail no new mail
		will be tossed. New mail will stay in your inbound now.
		Now backup your whole bbs and download areas!
		Compile the new bbs programs, do not yet install them.
		Shutdown the bbs with "mbstat close". Kill the mbtask daemon.
		Depending on your distribution as root you can do
		"/etc/rc.d/init.d/mbsed stop", the location may vary.
                Delete ~/etc/lastcall.data
                Delete ~/etc/archiver.data
                Delete ~/etc/virscan.data
		Because the macro template files are changed and you may have
		personalized them, these files are not automatic upgraded. If
		you want them to be upgraded delete all files in 
		~/english/macro .
		Now install all new binaries (su to root, make install).
		Delete ~/bin/mbfido again (to prevent tossing mail).
		Back as user mbse again, start mbtask by typing mbtask at the
		commandline. Now you are ready to check and update the changes.
                Start mbsetup, enter global configuration and exit and save.
                This will set defaults for area-/filemgr logging and security.
                The noderecords are updated with new security flags.
                This will setup the new outbound queue path, default is
                /opt/mbse/var/queue.
                The filegroups, ticgroups, tic areas and message areas are
                updated with default security flags.
                In mbsetup enter Edit Fidonet Nodes. You might want to check
		if all the session passwords are still ok. Also check all 
		nodes if the Pack mail flag is ok, this setting now also 
		affects echomail!
		In nodes screen 1, enter item 2: "Outbox dir" to set a outbox
		directory if you want that. This will propose a directory name,
		change that if you like to for example to a system or sysop 
		name. Don't use spaces!
                Check new settings in nodes setup, screen 6, items 9 and 10.
		Item 9 does not work if the node uses BBBS and maybe others.
		If the node uses Allfix or MBSE, 9 and 10 can be Yes.
                Check TIC magic records (menu 10.4), all filenames tested are
                now uppercase 8.3 names, adjust your filemasks.
                In mbsetup enter the Edit Archiver Programs. The new values
                should now be set. Do the same for Virus scanners.
		This is all for mbsetup.
                Run "mbfile check". This will create an error in the logfile
                for each file! It will update the filenames on disk to have
                both short and long filenames. Just ignore the errors but check
                for real deleted files.
		Now you are ready, install the binaries again so that mbfido
		is present again and you can toss mail. Do this with
		"mbstat set mailin", after a while all mail and files will be
		tossed and you are back in bussines again.
		Have fun.

	changes:
		See all changes from development version 0.35.01 upto 0.33.07.


				MBSEBBS History.

v0.35.07	11-Dec-2002 - 26-Dec-2002

	general:
		On FreeBSD the lsz and lrz programs are found as alternate for
		lz and sz.

	common.a:
		For testing purposes of the ESLF (Extended St. Louis Format)
		nodelist, debugging is added to show the information in the
		ESLF lines. Only visible with utilities debug 's'.

	mbsebbs:
		With menu 201 there is now a new optional data parameter N.
		When used if a user selects a different message area, areas
		with new unread mail are marked with a yellow star.
		Also with menu 201 these is now options U+ and U-, which 
		takes the user to the next or previous Unread message area.

	mbfile:
		The index command displays LFN names in the webpages again.
		The real download still sends the 8.3 name.

	mbfido:
		Better detection of zone information in netmails when netmail
		was stored in a netmail packet of a different network and the
		netmail misses a lot of kludges. Better logging of processed
		netmails.
		If a TIC file woth lowercase 8.3 filename is received the name
		is forced to uppercase 8.3.

	mbcico:
		Code cleanup in opentcp, better handling of given ports and
		better logging.


v0.35.06	13-Nov-2002 - 11-Dec-2002

	templates:
		The html templates are changed by Joachim Kuwan and now they
		are valid html files validated at http://validator.w3.org/
		This upgrade is not automatic because you might have personal
		changes in the templates that I do not want to overwrite.
		Another one changed is areamgr.status, that one had an error
		and did display garbage for the routevia address.
		They are in ~/mbsebbs-0.xx.xx/examples/templates.tar and should
		go into ~/english/macro/
		Some other templates are changed because they had spelling
		errors, you may want to replace all templates.

	general:
		Added better support for 8.3 and long filenames by creating
		symbolic links in the download directories.

	common.a:
		Changed the LFN name mangle functions to prevent 8.3 name 
		collisions. Now the basepart is 4 characters followed by the
		tilde char and then a 3 characters code calculated from the
		16 bits crc of the original filename. Original this was base 5
		followed by a tilde and 2 characters code calculated from the
		checksum of the string modulo 1849. Both methods are different
		then what MS does.
		Added long extension to 3 char extensions for mpeg, smil, perl,
		jpeg and tiff.
		The unpack function doesn't complain anymore when it was
		testing for the archive format on files smaller then 257 bytes.

	mbsebbs:
		Several user input functions don't allow comma's anymore.
		Uploaded files will now also have a symbolic link to then
		long filename from the real 8.3 filename.
		Filesearch on filename now uses regexp to find the files.
		The caller id didn't show up when the info was available.
		A user with only a limit on download files or download Kb could
		not download at all.

	mbfido:
		TIC file forwarding now uses a list of qualified systems to
		forward to, and with this information builds more reliable
		seen-by lines.
		Imported tic files with a new banner file in the archive got
		the wrong filetime in the files database. The mbfile check
		command would detect and correct this.
		TIC files added to the bbs will now also have a long filename
		symbolic link.
		With TIC file attaches, the filename attached is the 8.3 name.
		TIC processing completly modified to make better LFN support,
		internal everything works on the 8.3 filename.
		When writing ticfiles for downlinks, the To line now depends
		on the new nodes setting.
		When writing ticfiles for downlinks, the format of the Seenby
		lines now depends on the new nodes setting.
		When adding unpacked mail for a directory node, the mail
		packets had the wrong filename.
		Changed some logging to debug with auto create areas.
		Request messages sent to the uplinks are now logged in the
		manager logfile.
		Removed heavy debugging on some parts of RFC message 
		processing.
		During toss the Nopper code is called to prevent timeout when
		a very large packet is tossed that takes longer then 10 mins.
		When more then 1024 dupes were tossed, mbfido crashed because
		a temp file wasn't closed.
		The echomail dupecheck doesn't check the seconds of the message
		date anymore. This will catch some rescanned dupes that modify
		the seconds of the original messages.

	mbcico:
		With filetransfer errors, the attempts counter was not 
		increased.

	mbfile:
		Finished complete support for 8.3 and long filenames.
		The check function now creates symbolic links in the download
		areas with the 8.3 filename to the long filename so that the
		files seem to exist under both names.
		The delete and move functions can now use 8.3 or long
		filenames as argument.
		The index function now creates web pages with the uppercase
		8.3 filename (including thumbnails) because webservers don't
		allow downloads from symlinks and the LFN is a symlink. You
		could allow your webserver to do this but this is a big 
		security hole.

	mbsetup:
		In filedatabase editor, if a file is deleted the name is
		displayed in light blue.
		Added setup switches in nodes setup, files, to toggle sending
		advanced seen-by lines and the To line in ticfiles.

	mbtask:
		The outbound status didn't show the new error codes.


v0.35.05	19-Oct-2002 - 13-Nov-2002.

	general:
		There is now a mberrors.h file that defines all errorcodes
		returned by all programs.

	faq:
		Changed the section about ftp feeds.
		Added Q&A about failing internet polls.

	mbsebbs:
		Email posted at the bbs was not signed with the signature.
		Fixed the bug where the filearea number was lost. This was
		caused when a user was logged off before the login procedure
		was complete.
		If user was displaying the whoson list and there was no
		matching isdoing action then browsing will be displayed 
		instead of system error.
		Sends Unix name instead of long name to mbtask.
		During login the OS and CPU type is displayed.

	mbnewusr:
		Sends Unix name instead of long name to mbtask.
		During login the OS and CPU type is displayed.

	mbmon:
		In screen 1, username field decreased ro 8 characters and the
		doing field is increased to 26 characters.

	mbcico:
		Fixed crash with incoming YooHoo session with bad password.
		Still used the phone override fields for hostname override
		with internet calls if there was something filled in.
		For inbound sessions if the remote is listed in some nodelist,
		mbtask is updated with the sysop name and location.

	mbout:
		The stat command now also shows what is on hold for a node
		with an directory outbound (ftp node). Status is always hold.

	mbmsg:
		The summary counters in the logfile are increased to 6 digits.

	mbsetup:
		When installing the default unarchivers (new installations)
		the rar is used to unarchive instead of unrar when available,
		rar is compiled static and prefered.
		Added support for the nomarch unarchiver. Files are extracted
		with the -U switch for nodelists.
		Removed from Screen 1.13 the unused switches Res Future and
		Repl ext. Fixed some help texts.
		Added in screen 1.14 settings for Plus All, Notify, Passwd and
		Pause.
		Removed the default Virnet record from the fidonet setup.
		In node setup the pack netmail switch is renamed and is now 
		for all mail. Default for new records is Yes.
		Added length check when importing taglines.
		Now writes also ~/etc/msg.txt for MsgEd after messagebase is
		updated.
		When a new echomail area was created with a default group
		setting, then when the group was selected setup would create
		the jam basepath itself instead of using the base from the
		group.
		New JAM areas will not have spaces anymore in the pathnames.
		Spaces are replaced by underscores.

	mbfido:
		With ticfile processing, the KeepDate setup setting now works.
		The FileMgr requests now honor the setting of the switches
		Plus All, Notify, Passwd, Message, Tic on/off and Pause.
		The AreaMgr reuqests now honor the setting of the switches
		Plus All, Notify, Passwd and Pause.
		Echomail is now also packed or not according to the packmail
		switch in mbsetup.
		Statistics count for exported echomail now works.
		Email posted in the email box in full domain mode was refused
		by SMTP servers because of bad address formatting.
		Addex extra check to prevent overflow of arcmail packets
		extension. This is logged with a warning when this happens.
		If filenames were exhausted and the last one (ending on z) is
		truncated in the outbound (has been sent already) it is erased
		before the archiver is called to reuse that filename again.
		When mail/files were moved to the inbound from a directory
		node, this was not processed in the same session.
		Moved the ^aTID kludge to the top of the exported message
		after the last kludge so people won't complain anymore.
		With local hatched files, the aka of the tic area was not added
		to the seenby list.

	mbtask:
		Removed debug logging of "does" info.


v0.35.04	29-Sep-2002 - 19-Oct-2002.

	general:
		Added mail and files security flags for nodes.

        clcomm.a:
                Added Mgrlog function, logs default to manager.log. Does also
                log to Syslog with level '+'.

	mbfido:
		Area- and FileMgr requests are now also logged in manager.log
                Auto created and removed areas are also logged in manager.log
		Auto created area now get the link security from the group.
		With message areas auto update it should now only delete
		missing echomail areas.
		File attaches to our own points were placed in the node's
		outbound directory instead of the point outbound.
		Files and echomail security flags implemented.
		Echomail rescan will also work with newsgroups.
		Removed some debug logging with files replace.
		Fixed trashing news dupes file when mbfido was called multiple
		times. Improved program locking.
		Netmail received for a zone/net without netmail board will be
		stored in the badmail area.

		Added protection against emty rfc headers with only a space.
		Added test for HA archiver.

	mbinet.a:

		Corrected a spelling error in the Dutch language file.

	mbcico:
		Changed IsDoing information.
		Makes use of the node nodelist override settings.
		Fixed a bug that mbcico refused to do internet calls when one
		of the No IBN, No ITN or No IFC flags was set.

	mbout:

		The file attach function now adds the file to the queue, by
		setting the semafore mailin mbfido will place the file in the
		real outbound.

	mbfido:
		Rollover now only sets IsDoing when it really does a date
		rollover.
		When a new tic area was created the first file received for
		that area was refused.
		Fixed a few problems with local UUCP created netmails.
		Added routing tables for special cases. Most systems don't
		need this.
		The route test command now works exactly as netmails do.
		Implemented directory inbound tossing and outbound queueing.
		Rewrote the outbound queue system, the queue now works for
		files also.
		Removed debug logline with extract of FILE_ID.DIZ.
		When a file is imported with a name that is already present,
		the existing filerecord is updated and not replaced.
		There are people using M$ wordprocessors to create TIC files,
		there is now better filtering to get that garbage out of the
		received tic files. We will forward plain ascii of course.
		Fixed the outbound queue to send to nodes not in the setup.
		When mbfido stops with error 110 it doesn't remove any locks
		because this error is only being used before that main lock is
		made.
		Changed the error codes during init until the main lock is 
		made, this must prevent destroying a another lock.

		this file has been used.
		Corrected length for manual file description to prevent string
		overflow.
		Added missing space in message to user about file unpack.

	mbtask:
		Changed logging of multiple logmessages that are equal.

		area, filefind and newfiles records are automatic updated if
		they were connected to that area.
		Added setup for routing the table.
		Corrected several page layouts for printing on A4 paper.
		Added setup for nodes connected via directories (we are the
		FTP server side).

		Implemented auto area create comparing a new received echo
		from a uplink which has a echomail taglist in one of the
		mailgroups defined. The area is created with the defaults
		from the mailgroup.
		If mbfido fails to unzip a incoming mailarchive, a second
		attempt is done after a sync() and one second delay. This
		seems to be a kernel flush problem.
		The same goes for adding .pkt files to the outbound, a second
		try is done after a sync() to add the .pkt to the archive.

		the outgoing ticfile. For most files nothing is changed.
		AreaMgr and FileMgr netmails are now split into more netmails
		when the become too large.
		When a downlink requests an echomail area which is not yet 
		available, and there is a areas file for some uplink, the area
		is automatic created and a areamgr request is sent to the 
		uplink to connect that area. The area is created with the
		defaults from the mailgroup.
		Experimental patch in mkftnhdr to create a To address in news
		articles where a Reply-To: header is present.
		It was not possible to disconnect file areas.
		Added nopper code to full mailscan.

		When started a second time it doesn't destroy the lockfile
		anymore.
		When a converted email to news listserver message is processed
		that has a header line starting with X-MS-, the headerline is
		suppressed because there is no key for this header. This looks
		like a new kind of M$ standard. mbnews crashed on this one.
		Fixed a small problem in magic filename testing.
		In rfc2ftn the Approved: header now becomes a kludge instead
		of being plain passed.
		Auto file area create implemented, it can use plain tagfiles
		or filegate.zxx formatted files.
		The mbfido web command now uses macro templates.
		Areamgr uplink requests the sender name is now set to the
		sysop's name, so he/she will get to read the responses.
		New command: areas. This will read all defined area lists for
		files and mail groups that have the Auto Change set to Yes.
		Missing areas are created, areas not present anymore are
		removed if they are empty. Good for bulk areas create.
		When missing areas are created, uplink requests are sent to
		connect the areas.
		Added more checks to processing of file_id.diz files. Also 
		when it is illegal formatted the already processed lines are
		cleared to prevent later malformatted descriptions.
		The hatch and magic processors now scan the filenames to test
		using the regexp library, this should be more reliable.
		Increased the size of the buffer for filesort.
		Improved error reporting when file copy fails.

		No setup setting anymore for maximum POTS and ISDN lines, this
		is now automatic.
		mbtask will now update internal counters how many ISDN and POTS

		mbcico gets the tty to use as option on the commandline.
		Keeps track of the number of mailers running.
		Added default path for arealists.
		Keeps track of total mailer TCP/IP sessions and will not start

		TCP/IP trafic.
		Splitted no TCP settings in no IBN, no IFC and no ITN.
		Improved the ping tests, better errorlogging and suppresion of
		icmp replies that are not for mbtask. Better protected against
		flood pings. This should fixes the problem that the internet
		seemed down while it was available.

		Fixed binkp driver to accept incoming unprotected sessions.
		If a binkp session comes in and there already is a session
		with that node, mbcico stopts the binkp session with an error.
