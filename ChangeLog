		received tic files. We will forward plain ascii of course.
		Fixed the outbound queue to send to nodes not in the setup.
		When mbfido stops with error 110 it doesn't remove any locks
		because this error is only being used before that main lock is

		mailgroups defined. The area is created with the defaults
		from the mailgroup.
		If mbfido fails to unzip a incoming mailarchive, a second
		attempt is done after a sync() and one second delay. This
		seems to be a kernel flush problem.
		The same goes for adding .pkt files to the outbound, a second
		try is done after a sync() to add the .pkt to the archive.
		In the To field of a created TIC file there is now a comma

		the outgoing ticfile. For most files nothing is changed.
		AreaMgr and FileMgr netmails are now split into more netmails
		when the become too large.
		When a downlink requests an echomail area which is not yet 
		available, and there is a areas file for some uplink, the area
		is automatic created and a areamgr request is sent to the 
		uplink to connect that area. The area is created with the
		defaults from the mailgroup.
		Experimental patch in mkftnhdr to create a To address in news
		articles where a Reply-To: header is present.
		It was not possible to disconnect file areas.
		Added nopper code to full mailscan.
		Fixed a problem that caused a SIGSEGV when a node was in the
		ticfiles setup to forward file to and there was no noderecord.
		When a ticfile was received while our aka is in the path, the
		bad tic counter wasn't increased.
		Made error message in AddMsgHdr function more clear.
		Removed experimental patch in news->ftn gate were wrong To:
		address was created.
		The mbfido news functions doesn't abort anymore when a 
		newsgroup didn't exist.

		When started a second time it doesn't destroy the lockfile
		anymore.
		When a converted email to news listserver message is processed
		that has a header line starting with X-MS-, the headerline is
		suppressed because there is no key for this header. This looks
		like a new kind of M$ standard. mbnews crashed on this one.
		Fixed a small problem in magic filename testing.
		In rfc2ftn the Approved: header now becomes a kludge instead
		of being plain passed.
		Auto file area create implemented, it can use plain tagfiles
		or filegate.zxx formatted files.
		The mbfido web command now uses macro templates.
		Areamgr uplink requests the sender name is now set to the
		sysop's name, so he/she will get to read the responses.
		New command: areas. This will read all defined area lists for
		files and mail groups that have the Auto Change set to Yes.
		Missing areas are created, areas not present anymore are
		removed if they are empty. Good for bulk areas create.
		When missing areas are created, uplink requests are sent to
		connect the areas.
		Added more checks to processing of file_id.diz files. Also 
		when it is illegal formatted the already processed lines are
		cleared to prevent later malformatted descriptions.
		The hatch and magic processors now scan the filenames to test
		using the regexp library, this should be more reliable.
		Increased the size of the buffer for filesort.

                is set to one hour.

		first if it doesn't exist.

		directory with the adopt and import functions.

		create the allfiles and newfiles lists.
		Removed nonsense error message when stopped on a signal.

		change lasted 5 seconds or longer, the oubound will be
		rescanned.
		Lots of code cleanup.
		No setup setting anymore for maximum POTS and ISDN lines, this
		is now automatic.
		mbtask will now update internal counters how many ISDN and POTS
		lines are free to use for dialout.
		For ISDN and POTS calls, mbtask now decides which tty to use,
		mbcico gets the tty to use as option on the commandline.
		Keeps track of the number of mailers running.
		Added default path for arealists.
		Keeps track of total mailer TCP/IP sessions and will not start
		new sessions if the limit from the setup is reached. This will
		hopefully prevent that mbcico will use too much bandwidth on
		TCP/IP trafic.
		Splitted no TCP settings in no IBN, no IFC and no ITN.
		Improved the ping tests, better errorlogging and suppresion of
		icmp replies that are not for mbtask. Better protected against
		flood pings. This should fixes the problem that the internet
		seemed down while it was available.

	mbcico:
		Fixed binkp driver to accept incoming unprotected sessions.
		If a binkp session comes in and there already is a session
		with that node, mbcico stopts the binkp session with an error.

		nodes "try" counter, ie. make an undiable node try to call 
		again.
		The status command displays the call attempts.
		Removed nonsense error message when stopped on a signal.

	mbsebbs:
		On some systems the download taglists contained garbage after
		the short filename causing wrong filenames at the users side.
		Added support for external message editor written by Redy.
