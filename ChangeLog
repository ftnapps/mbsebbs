v0.91.7		07-Mar-2007

	mbselib:
		If find_rfc_charset doesn't find a valid characterset we log a
		warning instead of an error.
		Fixed some charset names using IANA information.
		Removed duplicate table column.

	mbfido:
		In rfc2ftn if we cannot find the incoming charset from the
		standard table we will fall back to the charset in the
		Content-type: header and try to initialize iconv with that
		value.
		For debug help to me, the headers Content-Type and
		Content-Transfer-Encoding are temporary stored in the fido
		message as kludges.

	mbnntp:
		Suppress logging of passwords.


v0.91.6		05-Mar-2007 - 07-Mar-2007

	upgrade:
		This upgrade is not needed if you are happy with the current
		symbolic links in the download fileareas.
		You need to remove all existing symbolic links with paths, and
		recreate the symbolic links without pathnames do:

		mbse$ cd /opt/mbse/ftp
		mbse$ find pub -type l -exec rm '{}' \;
		mbse$ mbfile check
		
	mbfido:
		The add file function now creates links without pathnames.

	mbfile:
		The check command now repairs filenames without using absolute
		pathnames.
		The adopt, import and move functions now make links without
		path.

	mbsebbs:
		Uploaded files now have symlinks without pathnames.


v0.91.5		18-Feb-2007 - 05-Mar-2007

		With this version de default internal character encoding is
		UTF-8. BBS users who have a UTF-8 terminal can use the bbs in
		UTF-8 mode and should have no troubles at all reading and
		writing messages in several language encodings.
		There is extra logging which will go away ASAP.

	upgrade:
		Compile and install this new version. 
		In all macro files html.* change the charset to UTF-8.
		If you still have all default macro files then in the source
		directory mbsebbs/examples simply run "make macros" to install
		the updated versions.
		Run "mbfile index -f " once to regenerate all download html
		index pages with UTF-8 encoding. Check the error.log for
		errors.
		In mbsetup menu 1.3.7 change logo.asc into logo.ans and make
		sure you have that file. A note about the logo file, it will
		be displayed before we know if a user has a utf-8 or ansi
		terminal, so change your logo screen so that it has no ansi
		grafic characters, just plain ascii with ansi color codes.
		Start and leave mbsetup, this will upgrade the newfiles and
		filefind reports to set a defaults CHRS kludge CP437 2 which 
		is good for reports with ANSI blockgraphics.

	mbselib:
		Fixed a too low memory allocation in clencode.

	mbsebbs:
		Added terminal setting UTF-8.
		Removed setting ANSI/Textmode, allways graphic now.
		All *.asc textfiles are now obsolete, only *.ans are valid.
		Display ansi file converts to UTF-8 if the user has UTF-8.
		Email and FTN mail reading now translates to the users
		characterset using glibc iconv.
		Changed menus lastcallers, whoson, userlist, pinfo, fsedit,
		timestats, filelist to output UTF-8 code if the user has set
		that terminal setting.

	mbfile:
		The index command produces UTF-8 webpages.

	mbfido:
		The make web stat produces UTF-8 webpages.

	mbaff:
		For each newfileis and filefind report there is now a CHRS 
		kludge setting. Reports will be converted to the selected 
		charset. Origin characterset is CP437 for now.

	mball:
		Now also creates allfiles.utf and newfiles.utf with UTF-8
		encoded text. These new files will also be added to the zip
		archives.

	mbnntp:
		Reading news outputs UTF-8 coded articles. Posting is done
		with the client side charset and translated when needed.

	mbtask:
		Fixed a too low memory allocation in clencode.

	mbsetup:
		In newfiles and filefind reports the Hi-ASCII setting is gone
		and a CHRS kludge selection is added. Defaults to CP437 2.

	lang:
		Language prompts 44, 75 and 76 are obsolete.

	script:
		Adjusted editor script to use nansi.sys if ansi.sys is not
		available in the terminfo database.

	examples:
		Upgraded the html macro templates to produce UTF-8 web pages.
		Upgraded the txtfiles examples to only have .ans screens. The
		logo.ans screen now works on ANSI and UTF-8 terminals.



v0.91.4		17-Feb-2007 - 18-Feb-2007

	upgrade:
		Because some directories will be moved, a special upgrade
		procedure is needed. Take the following steps:
		1. Don't install the new source yet and make a backup!
		2. In the source topdir run "make clean".
		3. Install the new source.
		4. Build new source, "./configure" and "make".
		5. Run "./mbsetup/mbsetup", enter global setup and leave with
		   save. this should move all your existing language files to
		   the new directory structure.
		6. "su", run "make install" and restart the bbs.
		7. "exit".
		If you didn't do steps 1 and 2 (automatic updates) and you
		installed the source over the old source you have some
		extra files in the lang subdir of the source. No big deal.
		If you didn't run steps 5 then the new language paths have
		the default files from source and not your own. Your own files
		are then still under ~/english/*.* ~/dutch/*.* etc. Move the
		contents of these subdirs into ~/share/int/menus/en/* etc.

	mbselib:
		Moved default language paths into ~/share/int

	mbsebbs:
		Moved default language paths into ~/share/int

	mbsetup:
		Moved default language paths into ~/share/int

	mbtask:
		Moved default language paths into ~/share/int

	lang:
		Renamed language files and changed installation paths.

		diesel macroprocessor.  EXPERIMENTAL IS UNDER TEST !!!
		Fixed a compile warning in the diesel code.

	mbuser:
		Set default editor on erased records.

	mbfile:
		The check filebase command now also removes dead symlinks from
		the download directories.

	mbfido:

		Fixed log message for scanned netmail.

	mbtask:
		Some code cleanup.
		Fixed s SIGBUS on Sparc/NetBSD systems.

	mbsebbs:

		complain.

        upgrade:
                Start mbsetup once and leave, this will update user records
                with the wrong editor choice, fixes the files databases if
		needed and upgrades the nodes settings.
                Add extra switches to unarchiver commands entry 11, see
                mbsetup for the archivers.
                In menus 7.n.3.14 check if the NR flag is off, unless you need
                it (which I doubt).

        mbsebbs:
                Removed antique line editor.
                Added check for users homedirectory permissions and attempt to

                There are no paths anymore in OLR download packet files.
                Made OLR bluewave packets CPU independant.
                Fixed a strange bug that ftell didn't work right, this caused
                corrupt bluewave download packets.
                Bluewave is now big/little endian correct.
                Added width marker for chat input and fixed linelength.

                joe editor can use that.
                Changed zmodem transmitter timeout to 60 seconds and changed
                the zmodem init fase so that clients that don't start automatic
                have a chance to start the transfer.
                The zmodem transmitter now uses buffered output.
                Added Change archiver menu.
                Added crontrol-U0 to display current archiver.
                Changes to OLR ASCII download:

                the chatserver setup.
                Several commands now send the server address from the servers
                setup to the neighbours.
                After server connect send the correct usernames already in chat.
                When the IBC server detects a IP change of a remote server it

                On shutdown also send PART and QUIT messages to all our links
