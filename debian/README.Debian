mbsebbs for Debian
------------------

    MBSE BBS is installed to /opt/mbse.  The user IDs mbse and bbs are also
    installed for use by MBSE BBS but their passwords are not set as part of
    the installation..

    The initial setup of MBSE BBS should be done by becoming the MBSE BBS
    system user (mbse) and running the mbsetup program.  That sets up any
    configuration files that are not already present.  The first user added
    to the system becomes the Sysop by default, and can be done by logging
    in as the bbs user.

    The /usr/share/mbsebbs directory is where the standard language, menu,
    template, and txtfiles archives are installed during the package
    installations and/or updates. During an initial install, they are then
    copied to the standard /opt/mbse/share/int directories for use by the
    MBSE BBS system.

    The standard html files are installed to /usr/share/doc/mbsebbs/html,
    with a softlink to there from /opt/mbse/html.

    An example crontab is available as doc/mbsebbs/examples/crontab.mbsebbs,
    which can be installed using the crontab command as the user mbse.

    Configuring inetd or xinetd.  For inetd;  the information in
    doc/mbsebbs/examples/inetd.mbsebbs could be added to /etc/inetd.conf.
    For xinetd: the doc/mbsebbs/examples/xinetd.mbsebbs could be installed
    as /etc/xinetd.d/mbsebbs.

    An FTN nodelist is needed for the installation, when the system is
    configured for FTN uplinks.

    If you get an error message such as this when mbtask is started: 
IBC: no fido udp entry in /etc/services, cannot start Internet BBS Chat

    That indicates that the entry for it is missing from the file.  Add
    a line such as this to the /etc/services file:
fido        60179/udp           # MBSE BBS Chatserver
