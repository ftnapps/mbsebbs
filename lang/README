			LANGUAGE SOURCES FOR MBSE BBS.
			==============================


This directory contains the language sources for MBSE BBS. The file
Language.xref is only a reference file with linenumbers and source
references. The files english.txt, dutch.txt and italian.txt are the 
real language sources. The resulting files dutch.lang, english.lang
and italian.lang are placed in the ~/etc directory where the bbs 
will expect them to be.

If you make your own language files, use Language.xref as a guide.
The syntax for each language line is:

KEYS|Language line

The keys are the keys that the users must press for the right response.
Order is important. The "|" character is a seperator, the rest of the
language line is the line shown to the user. Trailing spaces are important!

If you do create language sources then I would like that you make them
public available and send them to me so I can include them in the
source distribution.

The Italian language was translated by nervous@nervous.it
