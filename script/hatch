   Hatch files for MBSE BBS. All files you want to hatch must be
   in the current directory and must be owned by user 'mbse' and
   group 'bbs'. They will be removed when they are hatched, so
   this should be a temporary copy of all those files.
   These files must be real files, no symlinks.
   Long filenames are allowed as long as there are no spaces in
   the filename. The mbfido program will build the 8.3 filenames
   when needed.
   When hatching long filenames and downlinks complain about this,
   then with mbsetup set these nodes to 8.3 names.
