			MBSE BBS Script files.

If you want to make any changes to the scripts, do it here and not in the
~/etc and ~/bin directories. After making the changes do a 'make install' 
as root and the scripts are in place with the right permissions and owners.

Also, if you use a distribution which is not supported here and want to
have it added, then send the file installinit.log found in this directory,
SETUP.log (if exists) from the mbse main directory and a possible written
inew init script you may have written.
