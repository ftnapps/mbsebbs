			MBSE BBS V0.33.19 TODO list.
			----------------------------

	These are a list of things that must be implemented one way or
	another. Some things are urgent and necessary to operate the bbs
	without human intervention, others are just for comfort, or nice.
	I think this list will always contain items, I only hope the urgent
	matters will be removed.
	Note that most goodies are still in my mind instead of in this file.
	Classes: U = Urgent.
		 N = Normal, second priority.
                 L = Cosmetic or nice to have.


SETUP.sh:
	N: Better way to grep for excisting usernames and groupnames.

mbsebbs:
	L: Reading of function keys over modem lines, or worse PPP connections,
	   must be fixed. Timing problems together with modem buffering?
	   It works with direct serial connections. Note, this also happens
	   on busy LAN's between Linux boxes with normal xterm's.
	   Note: this problem almost dissapeared after kernel upgrade to
	   2.2.16. Another note, this does not happen over ssh.

	L: Must include SEEN-BY and other hidden lines into BlueWave  and QWK
	   mail, must be user selectable. see remarks of William McBrine.
	   The default is oke now.

	N: Rewrite chat to use "mbtask". Write chat functions into "mbmon"

	N: Implement session and time/day limits.

	U: Code cleanup and make a structure in this program. Remove duplicate
	   or similar functions.

        N: Received files not in an archive are not scanned for virusses.

	N: Remove memory leak during toss. (It's ok for less 5000 messages for 
	   each run).

	N: Implement long filename support from .tic files.

	N: When a news article is received from a mailinglist there is a valid
	   To: address in the message, the gate doesn't see that and uses the
	   name to "All".

	U: GoldED netmail from points, FMPT kludge is missing.

	U: GoldED messages to internet becomes null.

	U: E-mail for points get status normal in the outbound.

	N: Wish: internet addresses in the From: field.

	N: Also check for file_id.diz filenames.

	   make the CAUSE responses human readable. see McMail for this 
	   option.
