			MBSE BBS V0.71.3 TODO list.
			---------------------------

	These are a list of things that must be implemented one way or
	another. Some things are urgent and necessary to operate the bbs
	without human intervention, others are just for comfort, or nice.
	I think this list will always contain items, I only hope the urgent
	matters will be removed.
	Note that most goodies are still in my mind instead of in this file.
	Classes: U = Urgent.
		 N = Normal, second priority.
                 L = Cosmetic or nice to have.
		 X = Will not be done unless it's really needed.

everything:
	L: Implement IPv6.

	N: In BSO the i flavor should have been d flavor.

	N: Increase size of Unix usernames > 8. The limit on Slackware is 32
	   characters, defined in utmp.h in UT_NAMESIZE

	N: Add personal message area.

	N: Fix JAM message base endian on big-endian machines.

install:
	N: On some (unsupported) distro's with xinetd the installation script
	   also adds entries to inetd.conf.

libdiesel.a:
	U: Processed stringlines containing unbalanced " characters are not
	   processed, instead the previous macro value will be returned.

mbsebbs:
	N: OLR, implement file requests.

	N: Only count posted messages in local mail areas.

	L: ChangeHandle, allow own unix name as handle.

	X: OLR: include private email area in download packets. See also global
           wish for private mail areas.

	X: OLR: implement some global settings from the offline configuration.

	X: OLR: check qwke extensions.

	N: OLR: qwk, check netmail entered from reader, fido address missing?

	N: Translate characterset of messages to the users preferred 
           characterset. This is partly done for testing.

mbfido:
	N: Check all .flo files for dead attachments.

	N: Check all .flo files for to old attachments.

	N: Count posted messages during mailscan.

	N: Code cleanup and make a structure in this program. Remove duplicate
	   or similar functions.

	N: Process GoldED filerequest netmails with the filereq flag set, we
	   should create a .req file with the contents of the subject line.

	N: Process To: and Cc: lines in messages gated from Fido to Internet.

	N: Add macro's for stats of all months.

	N: Implement file requests for directory nodes.

	L: Add %from command to areamgr/filemgr.

	L: Add netmail notification of changed areas.

	L: Make it possible to only virus scan the complete archives.

	N: Let mbfido areas with a special switch update area descriptions.

	N: Send rulefile via netmail for each new connected mail area.

	N: Send notifications to downlinks about changed areas from uplink.

	N: Add statistic mail messages. Via AMC??

	N: After readalias we need to free the alias list when mbfido ends.

	N: Reimplement characterset conversion again on the gateway.

	N: Hatch statistics are not updated.

	N: Copy personal mail to a personal message area.

	N: Implement areamgr/filemgr %avail command to list available areas
	   from areas files.

	N: Add switch to tic areas that new links connect SR to the area.

	N: When messages are deleted in the middle (not the highest message),
	   after a pack the lastread pointer is too high and users won't see
	   any new mail until the number of messages becomes higher then the
	   position of the lastread pointer.

	N: Someday make retoss from bad possible (volonteers?).

mbcico:
	L: Implement binkp option ND.

	N: Overrule Down or Hold node is not possible.

mbfile:
	L: Possibility to skip file areas from checking and reindexing.

	N: It is not possible to import areas that run of cd-roms. Do we still
	   need cd-rom support with current hd prices?

mbnntp:
	U: fetched mail doesn't get the status Rcvd if it was for the user.

	N: Do a better job for message linking by newsclients.

	N: Lastread pointers are not updated.

	N: Check if it's possible with followup messages to find the sender
	   name of the original sender in case the client doesn't set the
           apperantly-to: header.


mbaff:
	L: Rewrite filefind search algorithm.


mbsetup:
	N: Add a check for double areatag names.

	N: Use some sort of sorting for the system aka's and make sure the
	   main aka with zone's is listed first. Having zone's mixed gives
	   too high outbound stats and the outbound is scanned multiple times.

	N: Put ZMH fields in the network setup for each zone. Currently Z1-6.

	N: Add switch for file area to skip checking and indexing.

	N: Add global setup in menus 9.1 and 10.1 at least to change uplink
	   data.

	N: See if a check can be made in file groups setup for the areas file
	   format, if a filegate list is installed and the filegate switch
	   setting is wrong, a lot of wrong areas will be created.
