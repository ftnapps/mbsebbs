			MBSE BBS V0.37.05 TODO list.
			----------------------------

	These are a list of things that must be implemented one way or
	another. Some things are urgent and necessary to operate the bbs
	without human intervention, others are just for comfort, or nice.
	I think this list will always contain items, I only hope the urgent
	matters will be removed.
	Note that most goodies are still in my mind instead of in this file.
	Classes: U = Urgent.
		 N = Normal, second priority.
                 L = Cosmetic or nice to have.
		 X = Will not be done unless it's really needed.

everything:
	L: Consider XML format for databases.

	L: Implement IPv6.

	L: Document error return codes in the manual.

install:
	N: On some (unsupported) distro's with xinetd the installation script
	   also adds entries to inetd.conf.

libdiesel.a:
	U: Processed stringlines containing unbalanced " characters are not
	   processed, instead the previous macro value will be returned.

mbsebbs:
	X: Better word wrapping or paragraph justification in editor.

	X: E-mail downloads with e-mail verification.

	N: OLR, implement file requests.

	N: Only count posted messages in local mail areas.

	L: ChangeHandle, allow own unix name as handle.

	X: OLR: tagged areas must have 3 states, off, on or personal only.

	X: OLR: implement limit date function.

	X: OLR: include private email area in download packets.

	X: OLR: implement some global settings from the offline configuration.

	X: OLR: implement keywords and filters.

	X: OLR: check qwke extensions.

	N: OLR: qwk, check netmail entered from reader, fido address missing?

	N: Reimplememnt CHRS kludge.

newuser:
	L: Allow handles to be the same as the unixname.


mbfido:
	N: The elist rules files are named (8.3) areaname.rul where areaname
	   is the first 8 characters of the area name and we use the full name
	   only. Make sure both namings are accepted?

	N: Count posted messages during mailscan.

	N: Code cleanup and make a structure in this program. Remove duplicate
	   or similar functions.

	L: Remove memory leak during toss. (It's ok for less 5000 messages for 
	   each run).

	N: Process GoldED filerequest netmails with the filereq flag set, we
	   should create a .req file with the contents of the subject line.

	N: Process To: and Cc: lines in messages gated from Fido to Internet.

	N: Add macro's for stats of all months.

	L: Implement netmail K/S flag to mark netmail Deleted.

	N: Implement file requests for directory nodes.

	L: Add %from command to areamgr/filemgr.

	L: Add netmail notification of changed areas.

	L: Maybe store insecure echomail in badmail area.

	L: Maybe store echomail for unknown areas in badmail area.

	L: Make ik possible to only virus scan the complete archives.

	N: Force processing of arealists so that all tags are forced to
	   uppercase. Seems to give problems in some nets.

	N: Let mbfido areas with a special switch update area descriptions.

	N: Send rulefile via netmail for each new connected mail area.

	N: Send notifications to downlinks about changed areas from uplink.

	N: Add statistic mail messages.

mbcico:
	N: Upgrade binkp protocol to 1.1.

	N: With binkp, if the other node is a binkp/1.0 mailer without MB
	   mode and we did send a FREQ, a poll must be created after the
	   session to pickup the result of the FREQ.

	N: Support binkp Argus freqs (Radius too?).

mbfile:
	L: Add a check to see if the magic filenames are (still) valid.

	L: Update <filespec> <area> <-touch>

	L: Rearc <area>

	L: Possibility to skip file areas from checking and reindexing.

	N: Add area sorting

mbmsg:
	N: With the post command if a netmail area is used the netmail area
	   will cause trouble later, should be blocked to be used on netmail
	   areas.

mbaff:
	L: Add setup parameters for minimum length of keywords.

mbindex:
	X: Add usernames index.

mbnewusr:
	L: On NetBSD, supress error message from mbpasswd.
	   -- Currently no access to my old Sun Sparcstation.

mbsetup:
	N: Add a check for double areatag names.

	U: PickAka function lets mbsetup crash if domain is 12 characters
	   -- Check, still so?

	N: Use some sort of sorting for the system aka's and make sure the
	   main aka with zone's is listed first. Having zone's mixed gives
	   too high outbound stats and the outbound is scanned multiple times.

	N: Put ZMH fields in the network setup for each zone. Currently Z1-6.

	N: Add switch for file area to skip checking and indexing.

	N: Add menu switches in nodes/groups to select/deselect all groups
	   at once.

	N: Add global setup in menus 9.1 and 10.1 at least to change uplink
	   data.

	X: Generate crossreference document:
	   File Areas      <=> BBS groups
	   File Areas      <=> Newfiles groups
	   Filefind flags  <=> TIC Areas
	   Echomail        <=> Mail groups
