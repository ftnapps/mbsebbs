			MBSE BBS V0.35.04 TODO list.
			----------------------------

	These are a list of things that must be implemented one way or
	another. Some things are urgent and necessary to operate the bbs
	without human intervention, others are just for comfort, or nice.
	I think this list will always contain items, I only hope the urgent
	matters will be removed.
	Note that most goodies are still in my mind instead of in this file.
	Classes: U = Urgent.
		 N = Normal, second priority.
                 L = Cosmetic or nice to have.


libdiesel.a:
	U: Processed stringlines containing unbalanced " characters are not
	   processed, instead the previous macro value will be returned.

mbsebbs:
	L: Must include SEEN-BY and other hidden lines into BlueWave  and QWK
	   mail, must be user selectable. see remarks of William McBrine.
	   The default is oke now.

	N: Rewrite chat to use "mbtask". Write chat functions into "mbmon"

	N: Implement session and time/day limits.

	N: Display textfiles and archives.

	N: Check for tagged files before logoff

	L: Better word wrapping or paragraph justification in editor.

	L: E-mail downloads with e-mail verification.

	N: When a file is attached with netmail that doesn't exist the user
	   doesn't see an error message.

	N: OLR, implement file requests.

mbfido:
	U: Code cleanup and make a structure in this program. Remove duplicate
	   or similar functions.

	N: Remove memory leak during toss. (It's ok for less 5000 messages for 
	   each run).

	N: When a news article is received from a mailinglist there is a valid
	   To: address in the message, the gate doesn't see that and uses the
	   name to "All".

	U: GoldED netmail from points, FMPT kludge is missing.

	U: GoldED messages to internet becomes null.

	U: E-mail for points get status normal in the outbound.

	N: Wish: internet addresses in the From: field.

	N: Process GoldED filerequest netmails with the filereq flag set, we
	   should create a .req file with the contents of the subject line.

	N: Process To: and Cc: lines in messages gated from Fido to Internet.

	N: Add traffic to html.nodes

	N: Add stats for posts made by external programs.

	N: Add macro's for stats of all months.

	L: Implement netmail K/S flag to mark netmail Deleted.

	N: Implement file requests for directory nodes.

	N: Long email gated to netmail and splitted in several messages, the
	   second and higher messages get the wrong flavor.

	L: Add %from command to areamgr/filemgr.

	N: Add areas security with flags.

mbcico:
	L: Implement modem connect response translation for ISDN lines, i.e.
	   make the CAUSE responses human readable. see McMail for this 
	   option. Info received that this may be done using mgetty logs.

	N: Implement MD5 crypt in binkp protocol driver.

mbfile:
	N: Add a check to see if the magic filenames are (still) valid.

	N: Update <filespec> <area> <-touch>

	N: Rearc <area>

	N: Possibility to skip file areas from checking and reindexing.

	N: Override timeout during virus scan when files are imported.

mbmsg:
	N: With the post command if a netmail area is used the netmail area
	   will cause trouble later, should be blocked to be used on netmail
	   areas.

mbaff:
	L: Add setup parameters for minimum length of keywords.

mbindex:
	N: Add usernames index.

	L: Chat with bbs users.

mbtask:
	U: When a new user registers and presses enter on the name prompt
	   and then hangs up (at least with telnet), mbtask aborts.

mbsetup:
	U: PickAka function lets mbsetup crash if domain is 12 characters

	N: Use some sort of sorting for the system aka's and make sure the
	   main aka with zone's is listed first. Having zone's mixed gives
	   too high outbound stats and the outbound is scanned multiple times.

	N: Put ZMH fields in the network setup for each zone.

	N: Add switch for file area to skip checking and indexing.

	L: Generate crossreference document:
	   File Areas      <=> BBS groups
	   File Areas      <=> Newfiles groups
	   Filefind flags  <=> TIC Areas
	   Echomail        <=> Mail groups
	   Echomail        <=> Nodes
	   Fileechos       <=> Groups
	   Fileechos       <=> Nodes
	   Fileechos       <=> BBS Areas
	   Fileechos       <=> Magic processing
	   Fileechos       <=> Hatch
	   Newfiles        <=> BBS Areas
	   Newfiles        <=> File groups
	   Echomail groups <=> Nodes
	   Echomail groups <=> Areas
	   Fileecho groups <=> Nodes
	   Fileecho groups <=> File echos
	   Fileecho groups <=> Newfile reports
	   Fileecho groups <=> BBS Areas

	N: Add backspace test and store result in global setup.
