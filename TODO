			MBSE BBS V0.37.01 TODO list.
			----------------------------

	These are a list of things that must be implemented one way or
	another. Some things are urgent and necessary to operate the bbs
	without human intervention, others are just for comfort, or nice.
	I think this list will always contain items, I only hope the urgent
	matters will be removed.
	Note that most goodies are still in my mind instead of in this file.
	Classes: U = Urgent.
		 N = Normal, second priority.
                 L = Cosmetic or nice to have.

install:
	N: On some (unsupported) distro's with xinetd the installation script
	   also adds entries to inetd.conf.

libdiesel.a:
	U: Processed stringlines containing unbalanced " characters are not
	   processed, instead the previous macro value will be returned.

mbsebbs:
	N: Implement session and time/day limits.

	N: Display archives.

	L: Better word wrapping or paragraph justification in editor.

	L: E-mail downloads with e-mail verification.

	N: OLR, implement file requests.

	N: Only count posted messages in local mail areas.

	L: ChangeHandle, allow own unix name as handle.

	L: OLR: tagged areas must have 3 states, off, on or personal only.

	L: OLR: implement limit date function.

	L: OLR: include private email area in download packets.

	L: OLR: implement some global settings from the offline configuration.

	L: OLR: implement keywords and filters.

	L: OLR: check qwke extensions.

	N: OLR: qwk, check netmail entered from reader, fido address missing?

newuser:
	L: Allow handles to be the same as the unixname.


mbfido:
	N: The elist rules files are named (8.3) areaname.rul where areaname
	   is the first 8 characters of the area name and we use the full name
	   only. Make sure both namings are accepted?

	N: Count posted messages during mailscan.

	U: Code cleanup and make a structure in this program. Remove duplicate
	   or similar functions.

	N: Remove memory leak during toss. (It's ok for less 5000 messages for 
	   each run).

	U: GoldED netmail from points, FMPT kludge is missing.

	U: GoldED messages to internet becomes null.

	U: E-mail for points get status normal in the outbound.

	N: Process GoldED filerequest netmails with the filereq flag set, we
	   should create a .req file with the contents of the subject line.

	N: Process To: and Cc: lines in messages gated from Fido to Internet.

	N: Add macro's for stats of all months.

	L: Implement netmail K/S flag to mark netmail Deleted.

	N: Implement file requests for directory nodes.

	N: Long email gated to netmail and splitted in several messages, the
	   second and higher messages get the wrong flavor.

	L: Add %from command to areamgr/filemgr.

	L: Add netmail notification of changed areas.

	L: Maybe store insecure echomail in badmail area.

	L: Maybe store echomail for unknown areas in badmail area.

	N: Make ik possible to only virus scan the complete archives.

	N: Force processing of arealists so that all tags are forced to
	   uppercase. Seems to give problems in some nets.

	N: Let mbfido areas with a special switch update area descriptions.

	N: Send rulefile via netmail for each new connected mail area.

	N: Send notifications to downlinks about changed areas from uplink.

mbcico:
	N: Implement MD5 crypt in binkp protocol driver.

	N: Doesn't poll internet nodes with non-standard ports when the
	   FQDN:port is in the override field.

	N: See if it is possible with binkp protocol to resume aborted
	   transfers.

	N: Implement binkp resync when getting files. Transmit works.

	N: Add better check for stale outbound locks, check if the pid is from
	   a non-mbse program or add a age check.

mbfile:
	N: Add a check to see if the magic filenames are (still) valid.

	N: Update <filespec> <area> <-touch>

	N: Rearc <area>

	N: Possibility to skip file areas from checking and reindexing.

	N: Override timeout during virus scan when files are imported.

	N: Add area sorting

mbmsg:
	N: With the post command if a netmail area is used the netmail area
	   will cause trouble later, should be blocked to be used on netmail
	   areas.

mbaff:
	L: Add setup parameters for minimum length of keywords.

mbindex:
	N: Add usernames index.

mbmon:
	L: Logfile tail functions.

mbtask:
	N: Add events.

mbnewusr:
	N: On NetBSD, supress error message from mbpasswd.

mbsetup:
	N: Add a check for double areatag names.

	U: PickAka function lets mbsetup crash if domain is 12 characters

	N: Use some sort of sorting for the system aka's and make sure the
	   main aka with zone's is listed first. Having zone's mixed gives
	   too high outbound stats and the outbound is scanned multiple times.

	N: Put ZMH fields in the network setup for each zone.

	N: Add switch for file area to skip checking and indexing.

	N: Add menu switches in nodes/groups to select/deselect all groups
	   at once.

	N: Add global setup in menus 9.1 and 10.1 at least to change uplink
	   data.

	L: Generate crossreference document:
	   File Areas      <=> BBS groups
	   File Areas      <=> Newfiles groups
	   Filefind flags  <=> TIC Areas
	   Echomail        <=> Mail groups

	   Fileechos       <=> BBS Areas
	   Fileechos       <=> Magic processing
	   Fileechos       <=> Hatch
	   Newfiles        <=> BBS Areas
	   Newfiles        <=> File groups
	   Echomail groups <=> Nodes
	   Echomail groups <=> Areas
