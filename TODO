			MBSE BBS V0.61.2 TODO list.
			---------------------------

	These are a list of things that must be implemented one way or
	another. Some things are urgent and necessary to operate the bbs
	without human intervention, others are just for comfort, or nice.
	I think this list will always contain items, I only hope the urgent
	matters will be removed.
	Note that most goodies are still in my mind instead of in this file.
	Classes: U = Urgent.
		 N = Normal, second priority.
                 L = Cosmetic or nice to have.
		 X = Will not be done unless it's really needed.

everything:
	L: Consider XML format for databases.

	L: Implement IPv6.

	L: Document error return codes in the manual.

	N: On some (unsupported) distro's with xinetd the installation script
	   also adds entries to inetd.conf.

libdiesel.a:
	U: Processed stringlines containing unbalanced " characters are not
	   processed, instead the previous macro value will be returned.

           characterset. This is partly done for testing.

	N: There are some bugs in the bbs list menu. Make it a door?

newuser:
	L: Allow handles to be the same as the unixname.

mbfido:
	N: Check all .flo files for dead attachments.

	N: If a download file is deleted by keep # then check if the file(s)
	   are attached to nodes, if so delete the attachments and .tic files.

	N: Count posted messages during mailscan.

	N: Code cleanup and make a structure in this program. Remove duplicate
	   or similar functions.

	N: Process GoldED filerequest netmails with the filereq flag set, we
	   should create a .req file with the contents of the subject line.

	N: Add macro's for stats of all months.

	N: Send rulefile via netmail for each new connected mail area.

	N: Send notifications to downlinks about changed areas from uplink.

	N: Add statistic mail messages. Via AMC??

	N: With auto created areas golded.inc is not adjusted to the new
	   setup.

	N: After readalias we need to free the alias list when mbfido ends.

	N: Reimplement characterset conversion again on the gateway.

	N: When adding a record to the toberep database add check for existing
	   older entry to update the info with the later received file. Else
	   just handle the record as a dupe (In test again).

	N: Hatch statistics are not updated.

mbcico:

mbfile:
	L: Update <filespec> <area> <-touch>

	N: The import function does not create long filenames.

	N: The import function doesn't strip the [0] from the files.bbs
	   when importing the description.

	N: The import function has troubles when there is nothing behind
	   the filename.

	N: It is not possible to import areas that run of cd-roms. Do we still
	   need cd-rom support with current hd prices?

mbaff:
	L: Rewrite filefind search algorithm.

mbsetup:
	N: Add a check for double areatag names.

	N: Use some sort of sorting for the system aka's and make sure the
	   main aka with zone's is listed first. Having zone's mixed gives
	   too high outbound stats and the outbound is scanned multiple times.

	N: Put ZMH fields in the network setup for each zone. Currently Z1-6.

	N: Add switch for file area to skip checking and indexing.

	N: Add global setup in menus 9.1 and 10.1 at least to change uplink
	   data.
