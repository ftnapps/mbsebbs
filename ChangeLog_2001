	MBSEBBS History in 2001.


v0.33.16	07-Jan-2001

	upgrade:
		Edit the crontab to comment out the lines with run_inout,
		mailer and mbstat check.
		Compile the sources.
		Stop the bbs, kill mbsed.
		Install the new binaries.
		Start the bbs as root with the new init script. It will be
		in some init.d subdirectory depending on your distribution.
		If you can't find it, reboot.
		If you want to start using the newsgate, run mbfido news -learn
		the first time to learn which articles there are.
		Edit menu item 1.14.3 and check that it's empty if you don't
		use it.

	CRON.sh:
		Removed the lines that ware replaced by the mbtask program.

	SETUP.sh
		Changed binkd into binkp because binkp is the official protocol
		name.
		Corrected a problem installing on a system without shadow
		passwords.
		Removed the part where the init scripts are installed. They
		are now in a new script in the script directory.

	clcomm.a:
		New function Syslogp, to log unformatted strings, the normal
		formatted string logfunction did hang sometimes when logging
		strings containing the % character.
		Improved some error messages in the NNTP and SMTP connections.

	common.a:
		Protected uniq_list and sort_list against NULL pointers.
                Handles the error strings now if there is a $ at the start
                of an logstring. This was only in the daemon but that didn't
                give the right errorstrings. Nobody noticed this error has
                been here from the beginning.
                Protected the chkftnmsgid function from NULL input.

	libdbase.a:
		Dupe checking databases are now loaded in memory when needed
		and written to disk only once when ready.

	general:
		Two new global switches, don't regate and allow control
		messages.
		Changed the maptab cp437__iso-8859-1 to translate 8bits dos 
		graphics to 7bits characters to make all fancy dos like 
		textboxes more readable on Unix systems.
		New setup parameters for UUCP newsfeeds.
		Added support for the PPC cpu.

	mbtask:
		New daemon. Takes over the functions of the run_inout and
		mailer scripts. This program launches every program needed
		to run the bbs. It will also check Zone Mail Hour.

	mbsed:
		Corrected a spelling error in the program header.
		Made the userlog full transparant.
		Fixed a memory leak in the userlog function.
		Changed file locking of mbsed status files to use fcntl()
		instead of placing lockfiles. 

	mbfido:
		Protected the rfcmsgid function against NULL input. 
		Build some protection against too long lines in ftn messages
		that were gated from rfc and regated to news.
		Removed a lot of #ifdef statements for gating behaviour and
		made a lot of code permamenent.
		Original code for #ifdef ALLOW_CONTROL and DONT_REGATE is now
		under control of configuration settings.
		Forwarded files had an old copyright message in the tic files.
		When sending messages to the SNMP or NNTP servers a line with
		only a dot in it will be sent as a space and a dot to prevent
		that the server thinks it's the end of the message.
		When sending or forwarding messages to a destination with a
		routevia address, the arcmail will be packed with the flavor
		of the new destination node.
		Magic execute uses the exec call now instead of the system
		call, the programs to execute must now be in MBSE_ROOT/bin or
		it will fail.
		If a MSGID is missing the dupecheck includes the message text 
		in the dupecheck. (Redy).
		Local posted echomail gated to news has now the right From: 
		address format and the right UTC time.
		Imported news messages had an AREA: line in the message text.
		Gating news to echomail doesn't crash anymore. Fixed several
		bugs to make this finally work.
		During gating news to echomail the mbmon program now displays
		what is going on.
		Added usleep code during news scanning.
		The program is now installed setuid mbse and setgid bbs. This
		allows it to be called by other users as mbse.
		New commandline, uucp. This allows mbfido to process incoming
		uucp newsbatches. Call it from uucp by:
		cat newsbatch | /opt/mbse/bin/mbfido uucp -quiet    or
		cat newsbatch | /opt/mbse/bin/mbnews
		It will handle compressed and uncompressed newsbatches.
		If a scanned netmail should be send via your own UUCP gate, the
		message will be handled further by the ExportEmail function.
		All other UUCP destinations will be send via the remote UUCP
		systems.
		News articles that need to be send via NNTP are now first stored
		in a temporary file. At the end of the mbfido run it will try
		to post these articles. If it fails (newsserver down), the temp
		file stays for a later try.
		Added newsserver options for submitting articles via rnews and
		to an UUCP remote host.
		Added alias database again that was in the original ifmail.
		Made a universal email post function.
		Removed sourcefiles addos.*, they were not used.
		If in configuration the root for the html pages is blank, then
		no html pages will be created.
		Netmail send to "ping" are bounced back to the sender if your
		system is the final destination. If such a netmail is passing
		thrue, the receiver is notified (trace). All ^aVia lines are
		added to the replies. Systems running MBSE 0.33.16 and up may
		now add the PING flag to the nodelist.

	mbmail:
		If there is no Organization header, the BBS default origin
		line will be used.
		Removed a lot of #ifdef statements for gating behaviour and
		made a lot of code permamenent.
		Original code for #ifdef ALLOW_CONTROL and DONT_REGATE is
		now under control of configuration settings.
		The packet routing is now determined using the mail tracker.
		The point of splitting large messages is now set at the point
		from the setup instead of hardcoded at 12 Kbytes.
		The program is now installed setuid mbse and setgid bbs so that
		braindead MTA's can still deliver mail to the Fidonet.
		Mail for users at your own bbs is now imported into the netmail
		board.
		Added REPLYTO: REPLYADDR: and MSGID: kludges if these where
		not yet present in the message.
		Added alias database again that was in the original ifmail.

	mbsetup:
		In menu 1.13 added allow control and don't regate setup.
		In all menus the default prompt selection is now "-" instead 
		of "0", so just pressing enter will leave from a menu.
		When editing a new message area the area is automatic made 
		active when you assign a group to the area.
		Most databases now create default records the first time.
		The sitedoc pages for the tty lines were to big for each
		printed page.
		Splitted menu 1.13 in a Fidonet and Internet part, added setup
		parameters for UUCP newsfeeds.
		In the services setup the UUCP/Email entry is now added for
		first time installations.

	mbmon:
		In all menus the default prompt selection is now "-" instead 
		of "0", so just pressing enter will leave from a menu.

	mbout:
		Fixed the helpscreen.

	mbstat:
		Removed the check command, this is now done by the mbtask 
		daemon.

	mbcico:
		Doesn't use tmpnam anymore during execute magic request.
		The openfile function doesn't use tempnam anymore if a filename
		is created after 62 name bumps.
		When searching for a matching aka and your first aka is
		disabled the first active aka is used as default.
		The closefile function doesn't use the tempnam function anymore.

	mbsebbs:
		When posting news articles when not permament connected to the
		internet, the From address will be Fido style.
		Messages for offline packets are now packed using the 
		following tests:
		- If area is netmail then only personal messages are 
		  included (unchanged).
		- If area is not netmail, and msg-kinds are private then 
		  only personal messages are included.
		- If area is not netmail, and msg-kinds are both (pvt/pub) 
		  then personal messages and messages without pvt flag are 
		  included.
		- Otherwhise all messages are included in the packet. 
		Removed debug messages for the POP3 protocol.

	mbpasswd:
		Fixed a compile problem on systems without shadow passwords.
		Thanks to Mario Mure.
		Corrected a missing library in salt.c
		Corrected a missing conditional header file in encrypt.c

	mbmsg:
		Wrote wrong CHRS kludge in the post function.

	mbfile:
		Warns about empty file areas during kill files.


v0.33.17        21-May-2001

	upgrade:
		Compile the sources. 
		Stop the bbs using the init script mbsed as root:
		  Slackware 7.0 and older: /opt/mbse/etc/rc.shutdown

	mbtask:
		Does all things mbsed used to do, it uses Unix Datagram sockets
		to communicate with the clients.
		If IP addresses to test are entered in the setup it will check
		if the internet connection is available with ICMP ping.
                Added Internet connection status, system running status and
                system load average to the GSTA command for mbmon.

		news.
		If imported netmail doesn't have a FMPT kludge and there is
		pointinfo in the MSGID line, the pointinfo is taken from the
		MSGID line.

		more clear that it is a TRACE message.
		The PING reply now uses the aka from address that was original
		the destination address instead of the matched aka in the
		reply message.

		filenames.
		Added support for a system alias file to convert fidonet
		addresses to RFC addresses.

		and Message-ID: are now case insensitive.
		File attaches with the leave case option set did not get the
		TFS or KFS flags set in the attachement.

	mbdiff:
		Removed some debugging logmessages.

	mbfile:
		Removed some unnecessary logmessages.

	mbmon:
		When viewing the bbs lastcaller list the clock wasn't updated.
		The <host> commandline option doesn't work anymore because we

		In the displayfile function the ^B syntax (show text above
		sec. level) is now: ^B<level>^B<text to display>^B without

		Implemented EMSI-II, FSC-0088.
		When calling a TCP/IP node with hostname in nodelist system
		name and a valid phonenumber, and if the hostname could not

		TCP/IP session over the modem connection. Now the TCP/IP
		flags are cleared and mbcico will fallback to valid old style
		phone sessions.
		In binkp added the M_NUL PHN and M_NUL OPM to log if they are 
		received from the remote. We also send these flags.

	mbuseradd:
		Error messages now go to stderr.

		Doesn't create the .hushlogin file anymore, not needed.

	mbmsg:
		Now runs umask(007)

	mbuser:
		If users at the end of the userbase are deleted and the database
		should be truncated, these users were not removed from the Unix
		system and their homedirectories weren't removed also.
		Added a check to see if the sysop defined in the main config
		also exists in the user database because these two must match.

		or may not return later.

	mbfido:
		Filefind replies had a wrong ^aREPLY kludge.
		Rewrote a lot of code so that similar functions are only once

		now always checked for missing FMPT, TOPT and INTL kludges and
		they are inserted when missing.

		Remove /opt/mbse/etc/maint to let it replace with a new
		version, or change it by hand.
		On RedHat, Mandrake or e-smith systems remove the existing
		start and stop commands with the runlevel editor, they will
		be installed with other values when the system is installed.
		If you forget this then mbsebbs will start and stop twice.
		After compilation and installation run "mbfile check" to
		update all file entries in the files database. This give a lot
		of output in the logfile, don't worry about it.
		In mbsetup 18 (task manager) set the fields 18, 19 and 20 to
		the right values of your system. Also consider the setting

		needed. All other users, (more modems, cable/ADSL etc) set
		this to No.
		Fill in the right IP addresses in fields 11 and 12 of your
		ISP's nameservers. If you don't have internet, fill these

		Patches from Bobby Cabral:
		- Fixed display file with more that stopped after every line.
		- Added display file "mainlogo" before the "welcome" file.
		- Added display files "welcome2..9" after "welcome1" file.

		Does now run as the users uid, not suid anymore. You are not
		able to login with Fidonet style name anymore, the mblogin
		program does this. Removed IEMSI support, this has no use 
		anymore. New users need to register with the mbnewuser 
		program, mbsebbs is only for registered users. This should 
		fix all kinds of setuid and security problems with previous 
		versions.

		name is created when the upload is processed.
		The virus scan after files upload tried also to use scanners
		that were not available.

		character if there was a dot followed by a space in the users
		name.
		If Ask Date of Birth is not set in the configuration the user
		can't change his date of birth and his age is 0 years. You
		should not disable this if you restrict access to some file
		areas if you want to test the users age. Also the age in the
		users record is invalid.
		Fixes for Sparc systems.
		System calls for archivers and virus scanners are replaced
		with execute.
		During startup the username is tried from the environment
		variables LOGNAME and USER.

		time + random dial delay time. Needed for mbtask.

	mbout:
		Fixes for Linux Sparc systems.
		The node query now displays the system open times (Txx) flags.
		The node query now also displays the CM,MO flags etc.

	mbtask:
		Changed to handle the External Doors flag in the lastcaller
		information.
		On new systems, ~/etc/config.data and ~/etc/task.data are
		created with mode 0640.
		On new systems, the DOS path isn't set anymore by default,
		most people don't need it.

		call even if there's no internet connection. Removes this
		semafore if there are no internet nodes to call. This can be
		used by ppp scripts to see if there is work and when there is
		no more work to do. Not important for permament connected
		systems.
		Made the FreeBSD and NetBSD disk status calls reliable now
		that I know how to really get the mounted filesystems.
		The system load value is implemented on FreeBSD and NetBSD.

	mbmon:

		Fixed the problem that the KillSent flag was set on processed
		netmail.
		Reset the KillSent and Hold flags when storing netmail in the
		message base.

		Implemented "mbfile adopt" function.
		Started working on long filename support. The real name on

		is performed on the long filenames.
		Implemented "mbfile import" function, this imports complete
		areas from files.bbs information.
		Added "mbfile toberep" function, this gives an overview of the
		toberep database. The program mbtoberep does this as well, but
		that one gives a complete dump and is for developer use.
		The "mbfile index" function now also writes files.bbs files,
		the index.html files for http download and 00index files in
		all available areas. The files.bbs files have download
		counters included.
