	MBSEBBS History in 1999.


v0.30/a		01-Jan-1999.

	mbfido:
		Removed a bug in the program lock that could cause a segfault.
		In delete viruswork made rm now work in forced mode.
		Hatch files now logs only hatched files. Added the
		statistics update.
		Changed completly the call module. There were some locking
		problems and modem access attempts when the port was closed.
		In Hydra the transfercounters are now updated after each
		succesfull block.
		Added more debugging log to the ttyio driver.
		In answer mode we grep the environment variables CONNECT
		and CALLER_ID created by mgetty and make log entries.
		Swapped timer numbers in Hydra, in tty_write we now don't
		test the read timer anymore, this gave unexpected timeouts
		and is not according the Hydra specs.
		Changed more debugging in ttyio, zmodem and zedzap are still
		not working well.
		Undiable nodes will not be added to the callist anymore.

	mbsed:	
		Added some logging in the ZMH status check to see what goes
		wrong with asking ZMH status.
		Changed the statusfile locking, now the lock tests are done
		at 100 mSec intervals instead of 1 Second.

	mbsebbs:
		Added CONNECT and CALLER_ID environment variables logging.

	newuser:
		Added CONNECT and CALLER_ID environment variables logging.


v0.30/b1	10-Jan-1999.

	common.a:
		Removed a bug in client.c that caused a segmentation fault
		when the connected tty was /dev/console. It is now possible
		to run clients from sysv init during system boot.

	mbsed:
		Removed a bug in the ZMH status function.
		Changed statusfile lock form 15 x 100 mSec to 10 x 250 mSec.


v0.30/b2	16-Jan-1999.

	general:
		Defined bitmasks for logging. There are now maximum 26 debug
		logflags. The logflags are changed from int to long.
		All programs have been changed to use these flags now.

	upgrade:
		In mbsetup set the new flags in menu 1.5.19 1.5.20 and 1.18.1

	note:
		This version still only compiles on Slackware 3.2 maybe 
		others, but not on RedHat 5.1 5.2 and RedHat 5.2 Sparc.


v0.31/a		23-Jan-1999.

	update:
		Recompile the nodelists. Remove old index.dir and index.pag
		files from the nodelist directory.
		Set new value for dialdelay.

	general:
		Removed mbsed from this source tree. From now on this will
		be distributed as a seperate archive.
		Finally found out why this package wouldn't work with glibc.
		Complete rewrite of the nodelist indexes. I don't use any
		dbm, ndbm anymore. I wanted username lookup included and 
		full support for ISDN and TCP/IP only nodes.
		It now compiles on RedHat 5.2 Sparc and Intel.

	common.a:
		Removed a serious memory leak causing the system to exhaust
		all available memory during long filetransfer sessions.
		Rewrote the nodelist lookup functions. Search is very fast
		because the index file is sorted on nodenumber.
		The nodelists will be closed after each lookup so that mbindex
		may always compile new indexes.

	mbcico:
		In call.c changed the port closing, it will now also close the
		port after an unsuccessfull call so multiple calls in one
		run will now hopefully work.
		Removed a bug when calling a TCP/IP node it was trying to
		dial with a modem.
		Added random number generator to set the dialdelay before a
		call is made.

	mbindex:
		Total rewrite for the new nodelist indexes. In -quiet mode
		it does the usleep(1) call every 80 lines (if set). Note
		that in quiet mode it still runs faster then with screen
		output.
		The index file is sorted before it is written to disk. This
		makes node lookup very fast (faster then with ndbm).
		The old files stay on disk in case they are open, which can
		only be for less then a second.
		The semafore compile is not created anymore, instead the
		mbindex program creates a lockfile to prevent that another
		mbindex can run. Compiling the nodelists can now be done at
		any moment.
		Username indexes are not supported at this moment.

	mbstat:
		Now only changes ZMH status if the status is really changed.
		Will create the "scanout" semafore if ZMH status changes (I
		did document it).

	mbmsg:
		Changed the logging, killing messages now logs in columns, so
		you can easy see how the mailflow and killing develops.
		Removed some debug logging (finally).
		When screen output is on, the last line is now erased after
		processing.

	mbsetup:
		Changed helptekst for mailer->dialdelay.

	mball:
		Now creates semafore "mailin" when ready so the produced
		allfiles and newfiles listings will be imported by mbfido tic.

	mbsed:
        	Changed the $MBSE_ROOT/sta directory to $MBSE_ROOT/var and
        	changed the names of the status and reginfo files.

v0.31/b		06-Feb-1999

	common.a:
		Changed raw keyboard read to get cursor movement keys and other
		gray keyboard keys. Only cursor movements is guaranteed to work
		This is a limitation of PC-ANSI clients.
		This change is needed to write the fullscreen editor.
		Removed memory leaks from getheader.c and mbfile.c
		Switched to one single .h file.
		If loggin "message repeated n times" the first character is now
		uppercase as in normal logmessages.

	mbsebbs:
		Implemented raw keyboard read changes.
		All actions in change.c are now logged.
		Made change voice and data phone work.
		Removed the (dangerous) gets function from funcs.c

	mbsetup:
		Removed ncurses code.
		In line editor the delete and insert key is finally working.
		Modified help tekst for modem hangup string.

	mbmon:
		Removed ncurses code.
		In line editor the delete and insert key is finally working.

	mbcico:
		If modem hangup string is empty only DTR-drop will be used
		to hangup the modem line.
		During ZMH mbcico will now only call nodes for which it has
		non archived mail (netmail).
		Changed ttyio debug logs, could block the session.
		For magic file and execute requests now looks for both upper-
		and lowercase matches.
		Filerequests are searched in the internal database on both
		long and short filenames, password protection is supported,
		and the request counter in the FDB is updated.

	mbindex:
		Doesn't complain anymore when the semafore "mbindex" didn't
		exist when it tried to remove it.
		Now tests for latest nodelist by filedate instead of file
		extension number.

	mbfido:
		Creates magic file names for magic filerequests.



v0.32/a		16-Feb-1999

	update:
		Remove symlink directories.

	general:
		Changed elapsed time logging, now ranges from seconds to
		days with the same stringlength.
		Moved signal names to common.a, also included the names
		for i386 and Sparc systems. 
		Added PackNetmail flag to nodes record.

	msgbase.a:
		Removed automatic adding of FMPT and TOPT kludges in netmail.
		Applications are responsible for adding kludges.

	mbfile:
		Removed code to work on symlinks for ifcico file requests.

	mbfido:
		Added some code to prevent memory leaks.
		The .pkt password check now always logs bad passwords, only
		when mail password check is set, bad passwords are fatal.
		Added code to keep dupe databases in maximum limits.
		Now forcing chdir to inbound before processing each .tic file.
		It will now export netmail from the message base. It also
		supports packed und unpacked netmail.
		Added TZUTC kludge (FSP-1001).

	mbcico:
		Changed zmrecv debug logging for hanging session with one
		of my links using InterMail 2.50 ML, rev B020.
		If polling all lines of a multiline node and the first line
		was successfull, mbcico would still poll the other lines.
		The random dialdelay is now always 10 seconds or more to give
		mgetty the chance to reset the modem and takeover the line
		between multiple calls.
		During dialdelay the IsDoing status is now sent every second
		to the mbsed so you can watch it with mbmon.

	mbsetup:
		Changed nodes setup so that password may be upper or lowercase
		for remotes that are case sensitive (was always uppercase).
		Added support for PackNetmail flags in nodes editor.

	scripts:
		In run_inout added the news gateway (echomail => news).

	mbindex:
		Now only tries to compile files with a numeric extension,
		2 or 3 digits length.

	mbsebbs:
		Wrote a simple fullscreen message editor, more or less
		Wordstar compatible.
		Fixed a small problem in the line editor.
		The maximum size of a message is now 500 lines.
		When replying to a message, the original message is quoted
		into the textbuffer including an introduction line.
		When replying to a message, "Re: " is inserted in the
		subject if there was none.
		It is now possible to send and reply netmails.
		Added TZUTC kludge (FSP-1001).

	mbout:
		With poll and stop command you can enter multiple nodes.
		With the request command you can enter multiple files.
		The request command doesn't create a .flo file anymore, the
		actual calling of the node must be done with the poll
		command.

	mbaff:
		Added TZUTC kludge (FSP-1001).

	mbsed:
        	Implemented CIPM and CSPM commands (online messages between 
		users). Updated the programnames list for check if the bbs 
		is idle. Changed the reginfo file lock to 30 x 150 mSec.
        	Fixed the Linux Sparc version.


v0.32/b		15-Mar-1999

	upgrade:
		Delete the newuser program and any accounts using it.
		Move compiled language datafiles to ~/etc.
		Move config.data from ~ to ~/etc.
		Remove ~/lang directory
		chown -R mbse.bbs ~/home/*
		Upgrade mbsed to at least v0.32 Alpha.

	general:
		The mbsebbs program now runs setuid "mbse" setgid "bbs".
		All files are now owned by mbse.bbs, even the bbs users
		private files.
		All references to directories for the configuration are now
		hardcoded to ~/etc, ~/fdb, ~/log, ~/tmp and ~/var.
		The directory ~/lang is no longer needed.
		The directory /tmp is no longer used, using ~/tmp instead.
		Moved the language sources and installation into this source
		tree.

	mbfido:
		Forgot to append <cr> after the TZUTC kludge.
		If we were a point, a route to our boss was not found.
		Updated for hardcoded paths.

	mbsebbs:
		Now runs setuid "mbse" and setgid "bbs". Changed the parameters
		to the mbuseradd program. The newuser program is now part of
		mbsebbs.
		It is now possible to run mbsebbs as a shell, it is even wise
		to do so!
		Updated for hardcoded paths.
		Sending and receiving online messages is now handled thru
		mbsed. You need at least mbsed v0.32 Alpha.
		Removed the last "gets" function.

	newuser:
		No longer exists.

	mbuseradd:
		Changed parameters to this program. 
		Finally worked around the problem of different passwd programs,
		we will now let the user supply a new password instead of 
		creating an empty expired password. The shadow password suite
		isn't necessary anymore but it may be wise to use it.
		It will not install /bin/bash as user shell anymore, during
		loading of the bbs users could get a shell prompt if they were
		fast enough. The mbsebbs program is now installed as shell.

	mbsetup:
		Updated for hardcoded paths.
		Updated screen 1.3, global paths. There is only one screen now.

	mbmon:
		Updated for hardcoded paths.

	mball:
		Updated for hardcoded paths.

	fbgen:
		Updated for hardcoded paths.

	mbfile:
		Updated for hardcoded paths.

	mbmsg:
		Updated for hardcoded paths.

	mbuser:
		Updated for hardcoded paths.

	mbcico:
		Updated for hardcoded paths.
		If the tty port was locked by another process, mbcico tried
		to close the port of that process (and luckily it failed).
		Now it won't try to close that port and try to remove the
		lockfile. Corrected the logmessages during this situation.

	mbaff:
		Updated for hardcoded paths.

	mbsed:
        	Forgot to close the reginfo file after the CIPM command, 
		eventualy the bbs stopped logging because mbsed ran out of 
		file descriptors.
        	Added the GDST command, to get the status of all (but no 
		more then 10) mounted filesystems.


v0.33/a		25-Mar-1999

	general:
		Changed the users structure for IEMSI flags.

	update:
		Open in mbsetup the users database, record 1, and close it.
		This will upgrade the users database with new fields.

	mbcico:
		Will dispatch mbsebbs when the EMSI string is EMSI_NAK instead
		of EMSI_INQ. We then assume the client is an IEMSI client.
		In the tty driver changed some error messages to debug log
		messages.

	mbsebbs:
		Didn't flush the screenbuffer when asking the user to read new
		mail so the user couldn't see the prompt.
		For OLR download the maxumimum number of file requests is now
		taken from the main configuration.
		Added IEMSI login support. Tested with FrontDoor 2.11/sw.
		Flushed a prompt after file download.
		The users filetaglist is removed from disk during logoff.
		Deleted Toggle Expertmode, menu 307.
		Added Toggle New Mail Check, menu 313, text code ^U1.
		Added Toggle New Files Check, menu 315, text code ^U2.
		Added Toggle Fullscreen Editor, menu 316, text code ^U3.
		Added Toggle Bulltins Read, menu 307.

	mbfido:
		Added more debugging messages for netmail processing. Netmail
		between a boss and point are being bounced between each other.
		At least they don't dissapear anymore.
		When forwarding a netmail, all original <cr> characters were
		lost and messages may have become undeliverable.

	mbsetup:
		Added new menu choices that were added to mbsebbs.


v0.33/b1	29-Mar-1999

	general:
		Added support for "pktdate" from Tobias Ernst. This is a Y2K
		.pkt analyzer and fixer. It is called before each .pkt file
		is processed. Indeed, he did also made a Linux version.
		Added support for ISDN and TCP/IP nodelist flags. They may
		be in the Userflag field or in the authorized flags field.

	mbsetup:
		Added .pkt preprocessor installation to global->mail for
		the pktdate program.

	mbfido:
		Inserted code to call the .pkt preprocessor.
		Should insert ^aVia line in forwarded netmails and exported
		netmails from the local msgbase.
		Will now put netmail for direct links that are not in our
		setup (by the stupidity of the Sysop, including me) still in
		the outbound (normal status) instead of /dev/zero.

	mbcico:
		Added support for ISDN and TCP/IP nodelist flags.
		Will now call TCP/IP nodes. This is experimental! It uses the
		proposal of Lothar Behet (2:2446/301) of 25 Oct 1998. The
		defined flags may be in the User field or authorized fields.
		At this moment only the IFC protocol is supported, the ITN
		support on port 60177 is under construction.

	mbout:
		Added support for ISDN and TCP/IP nodes.


v0.33/b2	02-Apr-1999

	general:
		2 new configuration items, user levels to allow sending of
		Crashmail and File Attaches.

	update:
		Set Crashmail and File Attach levels in screen 1.4

	common.a:
		Updated nodelist flags and rendundency flags according to
		errflags.zc2 dated 20 Mar 1999 (from 2:2/0). I should make
		an external table for this.
		If a semafore already existed (or was removed), nothing will
		be done anymore. When a semafore is created, fsync is called
		to make sure it is on disk.
		Totally rewritten the .pkt header read function, it is now
		more portable and does only one disk read to do that.

	mbfido:
		Commented out some debugging logmessages in magic file test.
		Corrected the ^aVia lines, in one case the Sysop name was
		included, in all cases the year was only 2 digits. For 
		debugging the milliseconds fields are now different in all 3
		functions that create Via lines.
		Now creates .pkt headers in a more portable way and only needs
		one disk write to do that.
		Now creates message headers in a more portable way.
		When creating notify messages, the correct local time is now
		entered.
		Created a new fidonet date parser, removed the bison parser.
		When messages are exported, the fidonet date is generated from
		the internal structure, so incorrect received dates are
		hopefully corrected on the fly. You should not need pktdate
		anymore.
		Now sets the local time when a message is imported.

	mbsetup:
		When creating new message areas, the security fields will not
		be preset anymore.
		Removed the gid and start uid values.
		Added setup for CrashMail and File Attaches.

	mbsebbs:
		Remove an extra close menufile in the menu processing. The
		Sparc version aborted with Segfault error on this.
		When a message is created, the time is now the correct
		local time.
		Now sets the local time when a message is received by the user.
		When a netmail address is entered, the user will now see the
		nodelist bbs name and is asked to verify it.
		Only above CrashMail level and if the destination node is CM,
		the crash option is presented.
		When creating a new user, the gid is now taken from the running
		process instead of the setup.



v0.33/b3	06-Apr-1999.

	general:
		Due to hardware problems on my bbs, I was forced to takeover
		the whole bbs on MBSE BBS, RA is now retired. This means that
		lots of things must be solved in a hurry from now on, there's
		no way back for me. The MOBO died, it is now replaced by an
		old 386/DX33, so I have to fix the parts that slowing things
		down. It must be able to run good enough on that board. This
		also means that only necessary things are developed from now
		on to create a stable and useable version.

	msgbase.a:
		The message header read function doesn't seek the whole
		messagebase anymore if it needs the next header. This will
		roughly triple the speed of scan for new mail.

	mbfido:
		Removed check for connected uplink if .tic file was a local
		hatched file, there are no uplinks for local hatched files.
		Finally found the bug where the TOPT and FMPT kludge info
		dissapeared from the netmails causing mail for points to bounce
		back to the boss.
		Added commandline switch -full to force scan to scan the whole
		messagebase for outgoing mail.
		If ~/tmp/scan.mail exists the area and message numbers are used
		to quick export messages.
		It can now attach file attaches. File attaches are not routed.
		If the imported file has a magic name, this magic is added to
		the file description.

	mbcico:
		Will stop calling a node after 3 attempts if there are no
		matching ports, or if there is a port error.

	mbsebbs:
		Abort on SIGHUP is not logged as error anymore but as normal
		log message "Lost Carrier".
		With netmails files can now be attached if the user has a high
		enough security level. Files must be in translatable DOS range.
		Fixed segfault when user tried to select an non existing
		filearea.
		Creates ~/tmp/scan.mail for posted messages to allow quickscan.

	mbaff:
		Creates ~/tmp/scan.mail for posted messages to allow quickscan.

	mbsetup:
		Finally added the pull uplink in file and mail group editors.
		In the tic area and echomail area editors if the group is
		selected and the uplink address is set in the group, the the
		first default connection for that area is the uplink.


v0.33/b4	13-Apr-1999

	upgrade:
		The ticarea, hatch and magic datafiles are changed in format.
		Order of update is important!
		1.  Compile all sources, don't install.
		2.  Make backup of all .data files in ~/etc.
		3.  Announce new files.
		4.  Remove *.*.*.*.bill files from the ~/tmp directory.
		5.  Disconnect all modems, networks and stop the cron daemon.
		6.  Run mbsetup from the source directory. ~/mbb0_33b/mbsetup
		7.  Menu 10.2, leave and update the database.
		8.  Menu 10.3, leave and update the database.
		9.  Menu 10.4, leave and update the database.
		10. If all is well, install the binaries, check mbsetup.
		11. Start cron daemon, connect modems and networks.

	common.a:
		Removed errormessage when created semafore succeeded when it
		opened file descriptor 0.

	mbcico:
		When searching for file requests it tried to use ~/fareas.data
		instead of ~/etc/fareas.data.

	mbsetup:
		Changed the tic areaname field from 12 to 20 characters.
		Corrected screen numbers in hatch and magic pick areas.
		Setting the magic "to area" now also uses the picklist.
		Does normal logging again.

	mbfido:
		Doesn't import the file area name anymore in the filesdatabase.
		This needs a workaround because this field is now too small.
		The check for quick scanned exported messages failed for 
		echomail if there was more then one downlink. This forced a
		complete scan to be done while everything was really ok.
		The .tic file dupecheck is moved to do a little later so that
		if some checks fail, the file is not in the dupe database yet.
		If the destination path is not available, the file and .ticfile
		are moved to the bad directory.
		Reads "Fullname" field from .tic file, logging only for now.
		Will now process archived tic bundles with extension .c00 where
		the numbers can be any digit. (Harald again :=).
		More errorchecking in Magic file procesing.
		Turned some debugging logging back on.
		Corrected a bug that sometimes caused a segfault during tic 
		processing.
		Corrected a routing problem if mail was to be sent to one of
		my own points, in case there where more than one point.

	mbmon:
		Does normal logging again.

	mbfile:
		Calls the Nopper() function now to keep the connection with
		the server alive. Good for slow systems and lots of files in
		one area.
		Removed a small memory leak in the check function.

	mball:
		Creates "00index" files in each download directory that is in
		range of anonymous ftp users. These files contain the file
		names and file descriptions of that directory. A new command
		"index" is added.

	mbaff:
		Corrected for the .tic areaname size of 20 characters.

	mbsebbs:
		Fixed segfault when user was trying to select a non existing
		message area.


v0.33/b5	26-Apr-1999

	general:
		A new set of grouprecords is created. This is for the announce
		of new files, so reports can be created by subject, ie. 
		Windows, Erotic pictures, Utilities etc. The groupnames are
		part of the bbs file areas.

	upgrade:
		Set in menu 1.15 the number of newfiles groups.
		Create the several newfiles groups.
		Install in all bbs file areas the right newfiles groups.
		Install in all newfiles reports the right newfiles groups.

	mbsetup:
		Will now ask if messagebase must be created if it doesn't
		exist.
		Implemented the setup of newfiles groups.
		Will now show the TZUTC time instead of system generated
		timezone (didn't work on RH systems).

	mbcico:
		Changed some logging, removed some debug logging.

	mbfido:
		Corrected a errormessage when the file import failed in a
		non existing area.
		If the file is imported in a bbs area, and that area has a
		separate Newfiles groupname, that name will be stored in the
		toberep.data file for announce.
		If a fdb area doesn't exist during file import, it will be
		created on the fly.
		Doesn't send empty netmails anymore if node has tic messages
		off. Only messages with text in it are send now.
		Switched .tic description lines logging on again because there
		are some strange descriptions coming in.
		Fixed a problem when there was only a normal description line
		in the incoming tic file, the downlinks got a shortened 
		description line.
		Doesn't strip Hi-ASCII from FILE_ID.DIZ file anymore, only
		control characters. Stripping of Hi-ASCII should only be done
		by file announce programs (if the moderator wants that).

	mbdiff:
		Removed a lot of debug logging.
		Removed unarchive functions as they are already in the common
		library.

	mbindex:
		Removed some debug logging.
		It now deletes old nodelists from the nodelist directory exept
		the most recent two lists. 

	mbsebbs:
		Added logging of selected file and message areas by the users.
		During mailscan and filescan inserted call to Nopper().
		Wrote a new Getstr function to create Unix accounts, this
		one won't accept spaces. (Thanks to Henk de Graaf, a user
		who failed to login).
		The username won't be converted to lowercase anymore when
		his Unix account is created.
		The Unix name has to be at least 3 characters.

	mbaff:
		In the announce function new uploads will get the area number
		as fileecho name so they will be announced by area.



v0.33/b6	30-Apr-1999

	common.a:
		Execute now only logs result messages if there was an error.

	mbaff:
		Added High ANSI to Low ASCII translation for echomail areas
		that need it.

	mbsetup:
		Added High Ascii switch in filefind setup.
		Corrected menu numbering.

	mbfido:
		After tossing a .pkt the result is only logged if there was
		an error.
		Removed 2 debug messages during netmail import.
		Made logging of "Keep files" final.
		Allowed hi-ascii in .tic files for the descriptions.
		Build in a check for multiple "Desc" lines in .tic file,
		only one is allowed. Offenders are logged, See FSC-0087.

	mbsebbs:
		Quick_Bye() is now logged (if possible).

	mbdiff:
		The resulting new archived nodelist will now be a lowercase
		name instead of a uppercase name.
		The new nodelist will be default be archived with the same
		archiver as the diff file came in, if it's not available
		there is now a fallback to ZIP which is always available.


v0.33/b7	10-May-1999

	upgrade:
		ACRmail 0.60 file naming convention is default off for
		existing nodes, check their setup.

	msgbase.a:
		Added a counter which keeps track of the size of the message
		being written.

	common.a:
		Will now create unique arcmail names for out of zone mail if
		it is turned on. This should prevent creation of duplicate
		arcfile names to the same node.
		Corrected logging of bestaka_s function.
		Doesn't create 00000000.fr0 ARCfile names anymore if our
		system is the point sending to the boss.

	mbaff:
		In the announce function added logging of the size of the
		written message.
		Inserted a checkpoint log after each announced block.
		Inserted code to split messages after 13000 bytes.

	mbfido:
		Removed "Packing Mail" logmessage.
		Imported netmail will now allways get the Private status.
		Added code to replace the archive comment, currently this
		works with .zip and .rar archivers, others don't support
		this.
		The ^aVia line was inserted at the begin of a forwarded
		message instead of at the bottom, it also had the address
		of the origin system instead of our own system.
		Also moved the ^aVia line in the other 2 functions to the
		bottom.

	mbfile:
		If during the check for missing files in a download area there
		is an extra file and it is not a regular file, it wil be
		ignored. This allows the use of subdirectories.

	scripts:
		Added support for binkd, if it is installed in ~/bin and the

v0.33/b14	16-Aug-1999

	general:
		This is the first public release.

	mbcico:

		In the openfile function added support to skip files already
		present in the inbound.
		Hydra and TCP protocol transmitters now send the filetime
		rounded up to even seconds just like zmodem already did, so

		The semafore "upsdown" should be set just before the UPS
		starts the real shutdown. This will force the mbstat program
		to timout after 30 seconds.

	mbstat:
		The wait command will only wait for 30 seconds instead of
		one hour if the semafore "upsdown" exists.


v0.33/g1	01-Sep-1999

		must be in the export list, unless the msg area UnSecure flag
		is set.
		Implemented the connected systems Excluded flag for echomail
		connections in import/export echomail.
		Implemented the connected systems Excluded flag in the AreaMgr.
		The Notify function now also sends statistic reports to the
		node.
		Fixed a routing problem (I hope) for out of zone routed
		netmail.
		When scanning outbound netmail the domain field is zeroed in
		the destination address to prevent garbage in the domain field.
		Patches by Jan van.de.Werken, files import now set the name to
		FileMgr instead of sysop's name.

		you can now disable a node from an area if a moderator wants
		that.
		In edit users added a switch to toggle OLR Extended Message
		Info in OLR download.

	mbsebbs:
		Now reads the bbs startup name from the configuration instead
		of using the hardcoded name "bbs"
		Writes a door.sys dropfile in users homedir. The first line is
		fixed to COM0 forcing doors to run in local mode. The second
		line is 0, meaning 0 baud is local mode. Let's see how this
		works.
		Added some logging for the OLR upload function.
		Now tests lowercase filenames also for reply packets created
		by MultiMail.
		Now includes the ^aMSGID string in BlueWave download messages.
		Optional includes all other kludges in BluwWave download.


v0.33/g2	02-Oct-1999

	general:
		Moved the mbsed back into this archive. Included the new 
		installation procedure.
		Moved the example files into this archive.

	upgrade:
		Remove $MBSE_ROOT/bin/fbgen.
		If you want to switch off CFG.dospath, be sure your outbound
		is empty or mail and files will get lost!!! Thus: type
		"mbout stat" and see if nothing is there before you do that.

	common.a:
		Patches by JvdW, if CFG.dospath is empty then fileattaches

		are translated to DOS style.

	dbase.a:
		If SearchTic and SearchMsg function the area must be active
		in order to be found.

	mbaff:

		lines in the toberep.data file. Also forced the long 
		description strings to be no longer then 48 characters.

	fbgen:
		Finally fixed this one. Can now read multiple description
		lines from files.bbs. Renamed to mbfbgen.
		The dangerous gets function is replaced.

	mbsetup:

		access instead of write access, it might be on CD-rom.

	mbfile:
		Skips the kill and pack functions on CD-rom areas.
		Skips the check of files on disk against the database on
		CD-rom areas.

	mball:

		then Unix style fileattaches will be created.
		Rewrite of file import function by JvdW to fix some bugs.
		FileMgr and AreaMgr global connect and disconnect now
		check if the area is set to Active.
		Rewrote ARCmail naming, zero length archives older then
		6 days are deleted. If a zero length archive then still
		exists, the extension number is bumped. This should 
		prevent using the same archive name on the same day to
		nodes with more then one mailsession each day.


v0.33/g3	18-Oct-1999

	general:
		Ideas for generating ARCmail names by Sean Rima and JvdW
		implemented.
		Lot's of cosmetic stuff to make commandlines, help screens,
		more clear and the same for each program by JvdW.

	update:
		In mbsetup 1.14.15 check that this is zero or the number of
		old days you want echomail rejected.
		Check in mbsetup nodes->mail that "ARCmail a..z" is off
		for nodes that can't handle that.

	mbcico:
		File attaches that are no longer on disk are now correctly
		removed from the flo files. Changed logging for this.
		The scanout function now removes truncated ARCmail files
		that are not of the current day or are older then 6 days.
		Corrected a bug that the inbound directory wasn't created
		when it didn't exist.

	mbsebbs:
		Now allows netmail crash replies.
		Can now reply netmail that came in via the UUCP gateway,
		when the reply is saved the message is readdressed to the
		gateway.
		Disabled the download transfertime check before starting a
		download. It gave unpredicteble results if the users previous
		download cps was bad for some reason, the user couldn't 
		download.

	mbsetup:
		New menu item in 1.14, "Reject old", to reject incoming
		echomail older then this number of days, or zero to not
		check the age.

	mbfido:
		The pack function now supports 'a..z' ARCmail extensions
		if this is on for that node. 
		It's possible to reject too old echomail.
		Short commands and options now displayed in the help.
		The fileforward netmail now set's the filemgs name first
		character to uppercase.
		The uploader name with file import now only has one
		name anymore, the first character is capitalized. This
		line should not be too long, this gives ugly listings.
		System aka's in the same zone other then the aka of echomail
		area are added to the seen-by lines.
		Added experimental zonegate support for echomail.
		Removed some debug logging in tic processing.

	mbaff:
		Short commands and options are now possible, like other
		programs already did.

	mbout:
		Short commands and options are now possible, like other
		programs already did.
		The scanout function now removes truncated ARCmail files
		that are not of the current day or are older then 6 days.
		Suppressed the help message for file attach, it is not
		yet implemented.

	mbfile:
		Short commands and options now displayed in the help.

	mbmsg:
		Short commands and options are now possible, like other
		programs already did.

	mball:
		Short commands and options now displayed in the help.

	mbstat:
		Short commands and options are now possible, like other
		programs already did.

	mbfbgen:
		Handles files.bbs lines of 255 characters instead of 80.


v0.33/g4	05-Nov-1999.

	mbfido:
		The final seenby lines are deduped and sorted before writing
		them to the in and exported echomails.
		Areamgr and Filemgr messages now have a capitalized first
		"From" name character.
		Areamgr new function: flow reports. Can be requested by
		%flow and is automatic generated with notify reports.
		Areamgr, increased the area tag from 20 to 25 characters
		in the notify reports and %list, %query, %unlinked response
		messages.
		Corrected a bug creating garbage at the end of the magic
		execute commandline.

	mbsebbs:
		Reply to UUCP gateway didn't work in real live, it seemed
		that the official UUCP gate had no ':' character after the
		REPLYADDR and REPLYTO kludges, while my testsystem running
		ifmail 2.12 for the gate does. I now test both cases.

	mbcico:
		Implemented remove ARCmail older then n days.

	mbout:
		Implemented remove ARCmail older then n days.

	mbsetup:
		Added integrity check for edit message groups.
		Added integrity check for edit fileecho groups.


v0.33/g5	13-Nov-1999.

        upgrade:
		Edit /etc/inetd.conf to add "-t ifc" for standard ifcico
		protocol, "-t itn" for telnet protocol.
		If you don't use the original binkp mailer, you may want to
		add entries for the binkp protocol, this will show the
		remote that you don't support the binkp protocol.
		The installation scripts are updated. See the file SETUP.sh
		on how the files /etc/services and /etc/inetd.conf should
		look like.

	mbcico:
		Implemented "not supported" binkp protocol.
		Revised commandline parameters, in TCP/IP slave mode the
		mode must be given on the commandline, -t ifc for standard
		ifcico protocol, -t itn for telnet protocol, -t ibn for
		binkp protocol.
		Starting mbcico without arguments will show the help screen.
		Now all programs do that exept the mbsebbs binary.

	mbsebbs:
		Changed language prompts 214 and 215.
		Added language prompt 46.
		Added message export to file function. The file will be saved
		in the users private homedirectory, the filename is created
		as <areanum>_<msgnum>.msg in MS-DOS format.
		Corrected display header of users home directory file list.
		Added import file in message function, the file must be in the
		users private homedirectory. This only works in the fullscreen
		editor.

	mbfido:
		Inserted 2 sync() calls during mailtoss. I hope this prevents
		temporary missing archives and .pkt files.
		New command, "tag", writes areas tagfiles for each mail and 
		tic file group to the ~/doc directory. Filenames are automatic
		created.

	mbsetup:
		In edit tic area and edit message area editing of connected
		systems now uses the existing node setup.
		Made a new menu selector for areas with Global and Move
		options.
		Implemented new menu selector in message and tic areas select.
		If you jump directly to a message or tic area with select, the
		offset is recalculated to that area range.
		Added global editing functions in message areas setup. Functions
		are add, delete, change connected systems, aka to use and some
		other settings.
		Edit a nodes aka's is checked if these aka's are used in tic
		and message areas.
		Delete a node is checked against aka's used in tic and message
		areas.

v0.33/g6	22-Nov-1999

	mbsetup:
		Removed a bug where you could not add new aka's to nodes due to
		the aka's checking.
		With database intergrity checks the cause of blocked actions
		is now logged in mbsetup.log
		If you change the number of connected systems or maximum groups
		in global setup, the databases affected will be automatic 
		updated.

	mbfido:
		When writing a notify message to selected nodes all other nodes
		received status messages.
		Corrected uploader name, removed "BBS" string.
		Installed patches from JvdW in file forward to correct some
		segfaults with the subject variable.
		The local hatched files are now moved to the inbound so that
		the unarchiver programs can find these files.

	mbcico:
		Added very experimental binkp protocol. Handle with care and
		at your own risk. This isn't finished yet.

	SETUP.sh:
		Fixed the script, there was one "fi" missing so the script
		crashed and didn't do all changes.


v0.33/g7	05-Dec-1999

	mbcico:
		Fixed some logging in binkp protocol. It works for normal
		mail and files transport.

	mbsebbs:
		Export message to users work directory did not put the
		message in the work directory but in the home directory.

	mbfido:
		Netmail to unknown bbs users are now readdressed to the
		sysop. Should be a bounce message.
		Added a experimental test for empty imported netmails.
		The netmail area Private flag is checked to see if we keep the
		original Private flag or force imported netmail to Private.


v0.33/g8	12-Dec-1999

	general:
		Changed the Makefile, make zip now puts FILE_ID.DIZ in the
		root of the directory tree so that file processors will
		find it now. This is a <cr><lf> version of this file.

	common.a:
		Removed and changed nodelist lookup debug logging.

	mbuseradd:
		Now check the existance of the users home directory, if it
		is found then it is removed before the home directory is
		created again. This fixes problems with RedHat 6.1.

	mbfido:
		Global AreaMgr commands cannot disconnect message areas anymore
		that are mandatory.
		Removed some routing tracking debug messages.
		Added check to see why not connected echomail is imported to
		the netmail of the last user in the userbase.
		Changed check to "Sysop of z:n/n@network" to readdress to
		the sysop's real name.
		After readdress a netmail to the sysop, the usersearch is now
		done again.
		If locking the message base during import fails, import is
		aborted.


v0.33/g9	18-Dec-1999

	upgrade:
		If you ever used DOSEMU then do a rm -Rf .dosemu in each users
		home directory. The ownership of these files are changed so
		they are created again when the user runs a door for the
		first time.
		If you have created ttyinfo records with just digits in it
		for the /dev/pty/0 type tty entries, you need to change them
		to pty/0 type entries. The example etc files are now containing
		these entries.

	general:
		All sources recompiled with memwatch. I will not name all 
		places where I found memory leaks, it was a lot. Still busy 
		finding them, but most programs are allright now.
		You can turn memwatch on and off in the file CONFIG. If you
		change it, do a "make clean" before recompiling the sources.
		Changed my Fidonet address, the testsystem is listed now and
		removed my old e-mail address which was not valid anymore.
		Changed the installation script. 
		For RedHat 6.1 and newer a different /etc/rc.d/init.d/mbsed
		file is created then before because the su command behaves
		different. The install script will try to detect this.
		Thanks to Juergen Heisel for finding this problem.
		Changed more startup and shutdown scripts.
		Changed language prompts 306, 311 and 324 to reflect 
		GigaBytes storage instead of MegaBytes.
		Changed language prompt 327, it had a space too many at the
		end.

	common.a:
		In the attach function implemented the global leavecase
		switch to be able to turn off the forced uppercase for
		file attaches when dos translation is on.

	mbfido:
		Found a bug where mbfido ran out of file descriptors during 
		toss, only about 1012 messages were tossed and then the whole 
		thing started tossing everything to bad. Jim Hansen who 
		reported the problem, reported that tossing 37500 messages 
		now works fine.
		Added the commandline switch -unsecure to be able to run an
		unsecure toss, ie. no originating checks are performed.
		Handle with care.
		Forwarded netmail packets got the wrong from address in the
		.pkt header.
		Added fsync calls after every write to a message packet.
		When writing .tic files to other nodes now the real aka of
		the tic area is used in the From address instead of bestaka
		match of the destination.
		All system aka's in the same zone are now added to the .tic
		Seenby lines.
		Will now gently stop processing if the upsdown semafore is
		detected.
		Added a check with file import that there are no more then
		25 description lines.

	mbsebbs:
		Added new controlcode, ^KM displays the users lastread pointer
		in the current message area.
		When reading new mail at logon, the users lastread pointers
		are not updated anymore in echomail/news areas to prevent that 
		the users skips unread messages.
		Only if a message area is Public/Private and a reply is given
		the user gets the question Private y/N. On other cases the
		flag is automatic set.
		With netmail reply if enough security level a file may be
		attached.
		The door.sys dropfile date formats are now fixed. Depending
		on the menu settings it can be original (pre 2000) format or
		have four digit year numbers, the new style. Writing the
		dropfile can also be suppressed.
		Removed the setuid calls before and after running a door,
		mbsebbs now always runs as user "mbse".
		The $HOME environment variable is now forced to the users
		real home directory, even if mbsebbs is started as user bbs.
		When the user logs in, the existance of the subdirecties
		.dosemu/run and .dosemu/tmp are created in the users home
		directory if they don't exist. DOSEMU is happy with that.
		Because of this, all files in the users directories are now
		only owned by user mbse.
		Moved the setup of last message and file area to a later
		startup point in userlogin.
		Autoexecuted menus are now also checked for user security
		and user age.
		Fixed the screen output of several bbs list menus.
		Now handles the /dev/pty/0 device names found on newer
		Linux distributions.
		It will now also create the necesary subdirectories for the
		/dev/pty/n devices.

	mbaff:
		The written messages statistics counters always counted at
		sunday in januari.

	mbmsg:
		Added message post from a file function.

	mbsetup:
		With the filebase editor I got segmentation faults on a Sun
		Sparc machine, changed the filedate calls. They show up the
		local time now also.
		Added the global editor for the tic areas.
		Added in menu 1.3 a switch to leave to case for .flo files
		original, ie. not forcing it to uppercase.
		Added menu creation in menus setup.
		Added setup to suppress the creation of a door.sys dropfile,
		and the ability to write the years in four digit format in
		the door.sys file. Newer doors seem to understand this.
		Added delete menu item in menu setup, finally.
		Added menu item move.
		The menu editor now shows the autoexec menus with the
		lightred lowercase "a" at the selection key position.
		When a new config.data is created, the default loglevels
		are now set to normal values.

	mbcico:
		Forgot to implement the NoTCP global and per node flag.
		If you are not permanent connected to the net, use these
		to prevent the use of internet protocols.

	mbmon:
		Screen 5 now calls Nopper() to keep the server alive.
		Corrected screen display numbers 5 and 6.
