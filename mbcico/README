This is the README file for mbcico, the fidonet mailer for MBSE BBS.

This is a heavily patched version of ifcico from the ifmail package written
by Eugene G. Crosser (crosser@pccross.msk.su), 2:5020/230@fidonet. He deserves
most of the credits for this product.

Many others have contributed to the original ifcico and utilities. This
version doesn't use the original config file anymore, it uses the databases
that are maintained with mbsetup. Also, mail behaviour is different then
in ifcico.

I wrote this special version to let it fully integrate with all the other
programs that are distributed with MBSE BBS, so mbcico will hopefully function
in a multiline environment with mixed analogue modems and ISDN lines.

The reason why I changed the name of this program is only to show that there
is a real difference in the behavior and configuration compared with ifcico.

If you insist on running the original ifcico on your system, it is still
possible, I used it myself during the development of MBSE BBS. You need to
run ifcico as the mbse admin user in the bbs group. Also make sure that the
order of the nodelists is exactly the same in ifcico and MBSE BBS.

The following people donated code to the original ifcico, this list is 
not complete. It is possible that I forgot someone, but these are the names
that I found in the several ifmail packages.
