	MBSEBBS History in 2000.


v0.33.10	24-Jan-2000

	general:
		Changed version numbering. From now on, minor odd numbers
		are testversions, even are stable. Same as with the
		Linux kernel.
		Changed the setup script, it should now detect SuSE systems.
		This is not tested.

	update:
		Remove (as root) all bbs users from /etc/ftpusers. They are
		not needed (and never were).
		Compile and install this release.
		Kill mbsed (killall -9 mbsed).
		Edit $MBSE_ROOT/etc/mbsed.conf, remove the line with logdebug
		and the commentlines above.
		Start mbsed again (/opt/mbse/bin/mbsed).
		Then start mbsetup, open the global menu 1, and exit. Answer 
		yes to update. 
		If you have any echomail passthru areas, give them a 
		message base path. Passthru doesn't exist anymore.

	common.a:
		The file_crc function now supports the usleep(1) code
		for background processing.
		The logfunctions now replace <cr> and <lf> with spaces.

	msgbase.a:
		Corrected a bug in the Pack function when the headerfile
		was corrupt. If the header is corrupt, the index file is
		used to find the right recordposition again. Errors are
		logged.

	mbsed:
		Removed the logdebug loglevels. Logging is fixed now.
		Changed the answers for the SBBS command.

	mbsetup:
		Added a global setup screen for the ftp server.
		Added a switch in the menus setup for doors to set a flag 
		to create door.sys files for dosemu/Vmodem use.
		Revised the message area setup screen.
		Changed text's in global mailer setup to indicate that the
		mailer flags are for TCP/IP connections.

	mbuseradd:
		Doesn't add usernames anymore to /etc/ftpusers. This is not
		needed for standard ftp security.

	mbcico:
		Added send filerequest to the binkp protocol. In single
		batch mode, you need to connect a second time to get the
		request response. This is normal single batch behaviour.
		Nodelist flag for Binkp mode is XX. (For POTS/ISDN XA).
		Added received filerequest to the binkp protocol. In single 
		batch mode this will put the files on hold. Multiple batch
		mode works now but is only tested against another mbcico
		mailer.
		Calling internet nodes could not use a forced hostname or
		IP address. Fixed. Added search in nodes setup phone 
		fields for hostname/IP address, search in nodelist location
		entry (2 nodes on the world do that, I needed one of them),
		and the IP notation in the nodelist phone field (000-...).
		Hostnames after the flags are not resolved, hostnames 
		should be in the system name field.
		In the binkp protocol the flags from the global mailer
		setup are sent as our flags.

	mbsebbs:
		The next two pathes are from Ken Bowley.
		Changed the fullscreen editor with patches from Ken Bowley.
		Improved behaviour for inserting and deleting text.
		Changed the door.sys creation, if the COM port option in
		the menu files is on, the door.sys file writes COM1 in
		it with a portspeed of 115200. This is for running doors
		under dosemu and a patched Vmodem.
		Made newmail scan and other checks for personal mail case
		insensitive.
		The fullscreen editor source now has an extra define FSEDIT
		to enable heavy debugging logs.
		It didn't respect the BBS closed status on lines that did
		not honor ZMH status.
		Removed "Re:" debug logging from mail.c

	mbfido:
		Corrected the queue path for tic passthru areas, the 
		destination path missed a /.
		Delete file from the inbound with passthru areas is now at a 
		later point.
		Removed the message passthru switch, you needed and area
		 anyway.

	mbstat:
		Corrected screen output when it was waiting for the bbs to 
		close.

	mbftpd:
		New! Special ftp server for MBSE BBS. Should use BBS users
		access restrictions etc. Doesn't work yet so don't use it.
		It is included in the distribution, but not compiled or
		installed.


v0.33.11	07-Mar-2000

	upgrade:
		Change the CLIENT line in ~/etc/mbsed.conf, the authcode must 
		now come behind the hostname. Remove the AUTHCODE line.

		The same changes must be made to ~/etc/client.conf 
		Run mbsetup, goto 1.17 and 1.18 and set it up for your system.

		If a client fails server authorization, it will now proper 
		close the server connection.

	mbsed:
		The syntax of the client lines in mbsed.conf is changed,

		clients. The index files are stored in the download directories. 
		If a download directory contains .gif or .jpg files then

		in the index.html files.
		You need "convert" of the ImageMagick package to use that 
		future.

		with the mbfile check option.
		Pack and Move file functions will now also delete or move the

		377, 391..397, 411, 425, 439..460.  Replaced a language prompt 
		in the Language load function with a hardcoded message.

		files.css from the distribution archive in it. Then run
		mball index. Customize files.css to your taste.

		are now added if they were not found during mailscan.
		The unarc/viruscheck directory is now completly removed after
		use and created again. Sometimes files with strange names 
		were left behind with a normal recursive remove.

		If in nodes setup the FNC flag is set, the binkp protocol
		will now send old 8.3 uppercase filenames to the remote.

		When multiple polls on the commandline are given, if one of

	mbmon:
		Will now free the server autorisation table at exit.

	mbmail:
		New program, use this to replace ifmail from the ifmail package
		for the email gateway if you had that installed. If it is then
		it's probably configured in /etc/sendmail.cf or whatever other
		MTA you are using.
