<H1>MBSE BBS Setup - File Echo's Setup - File Groups.</H1>
<P>

<H3>Introduction.</H3>
<P>
File echo groups are to logically divide your file echo's for different 
file distribution networks. It makes sense to select the groups by uplink and
area file that is available for that file distribution network. By doing that 
downlinks can connect areas that are not yet connected at your bbs but are
available from your uplink. NOTE: uplink requests is not yet implemented.
<P>&nbsp;<p>

<h3>Cost Sharing.</H3>
<P>
With the setup of groups you can also specify the Cost Sharing for the
files distribution. The unit cost is the cost for each transmitted file
if the unit size field is zero, or the unit price per transmitted unit size.
The final cost is multiplied with the "Add Prom." factor to add taxes or so.
Also if your uplink sends advanced .tic files, the cost found in that .tic
file will be added to the cost as well. Further you can set the final price
to divide between your downlinks or let them all pay the full price.
