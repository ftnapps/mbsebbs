<H1>MBSE BBS Setup - BBS Users.</H1>
<P>

<H3>Introduction.</H3>
<P>
This screen lets you edit some settings of the BBS users. Note that the users
database will never be packed and users will always keep their record number.
If a user is deleted the record will be blanked. New users will get a blank
record if it exists, otherwise the database will be expanded. The reason for
this is the LastRead pointers of the message areas, BBS systems who do it
in another method mostly can't keep track of LastRead pointers and records,
and they mix all users LastRead pointers. Fields that
can be changed by the users themselves are marked with a <b>*</b>.
