<H1>MBSE BBS Setup - BBS Setup - Transfer Protocols.</H1>
<P>

<H3>Introduction.</H3>
<p>
It might look strange that you have to define transfer protocols for the bbs
while for the mailer you don't need to do that. This is historic, ifcico 
already had internal protocols and the precessor of the bbs package had external
protocols. Because my priority was make the bbs working it still is that way.
When time comes I will build some of the protocols internal, adding external
protocols will allways be possible.
<p>
When you configured the sources and build mbse, the configure script searched
for excisting transfer protocols. When mbsetup was run the first time, when mbtask was
started, the protocols found on your system are already configured with the
right paths and enabled.
