<H1>MBSE BBS Setup - Fidonet nodes.</H1>
<P>

<h3>Introduction</H3>
<P>
Unlike many other bbs packages, for each node you need only one record. If you
have a relation with a node for one network with costsharing, and other 
networks without costsharing you need two records for that node. For each node
you can setup the aka's, mail, files and session handshake. There are eight
screens for each node.
<p>&nbsp;<p>

<H3>Edit general setup</H3>
<p>
This screen has the general information for the node. The contact info fields are
just for private use, these fields are only used in this screen. The Outbox dir is for
files to sent to the node, all file you put in there will be sent to the remote if
user mbse has read/write access to the file. Only real files are allowed, not symlinks etc.
<pre>
<strong>Sysop name       </strong>The name of the system operator.

                 node will be send via this Aka, even mail 
                 and files for other networks. This can be
                 usefull if this node has internet access
                 so you can send everything to this node
                 over the internet.

                 nodelist. If you call this node via TCP/IP
                 and the IP address can't be resolved by
                 the nodelist, you may enter an IP address
