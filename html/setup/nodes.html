<H1>MBSE BBS Setup - Fidonet nodes.</H1>
<P>

<h3>Introduction</H3>
<P>
Unlike many other bbs packages, for each node you need only one record. If you
have a relation with a node for one network with costsharing, and other 
networks without costsharing you need two records for that node. For each node
you can setup the aka's, mail, files and session handshake.
<p>&nbsp;<p>

<H3>Main setup</H3>
<p>
<pre>
<strong>Sysop name       </strong>The name of the system operator.
<strong>Fido aka's       </strong>Maximum 20 Fido addresses.
<strong>Dial command     </strong>You can put an override here for the normal 
                 dial command. If you leave this empty the 
                 command from the modem setup is used.
<strong>Phone number 1   </strong>An alternative phone number/ip address to dial.
<strong>Phone number 2   </strong>An alternative phone number/ip address to dial.
                 Use these above commands if the node has
                 another phone number as mentioned in the
                 nodelist. If you call this node via TCP/IP
                 and the IP address can't be resolved by
                 the nodelist, you may enter an IP address
                 or hostname here.
<strong>Route via        </strong>A route via Fido address. All mail for this
                 node will be send via this Aka, even mail 
                 and files for other networks. This can be
                 usefull if this node has internet access
                 so you can send everything to this node
                 over the internet.
<strong>Netmail direct   </strong>Set "direct" flag in netmail to this node.
<strong>Netmail crash    </strong>Send netmail always "crash" to this node.
<strong>Netmail hold     </strong>Put mail on "hold" for this node.
<strong>Send notify      </strong>Send automatic generated notify messages.
<strong>Language         </strong>The language to use (not yet working).
<strong>Deleted          </strong>If this node must be deleted.
<strong>No EMSI          </strong>Disable EMSI handshake.
<strong>No YooHoo/2U2    </strong>Disable FTSC-0006 handshake.
<strong>No Filerequest   </strong>Disable filerquest from this node.
<strong>Don't call       </strong>Do not call this node.
<strong>No Hold mail     </strong>Only pickup mail if we call, send nothing.
<strong>Pickup primary   </strong>Only exchange mail for one Aka.
<strong>No Zmodem        </strong>Disable Zmodem protocol.
<strong>No Zedzap        </strong>Disable Zedzap protocol.
<strong>No Hydra         </strong>Disable Hydra protocol.
<strong>No TCP/IP        </strong>Disbale TCP/IP protocol, forces dial only.

<H3>Mail setup</H3>
<P>
<pre>
<strong>Session pwd      </strong>The mailer session password.
<strong>Check PKT pwd    </strong>Check password in received .pkt files. If not,
                 errors or missing passwords are only logged.
                 If set, errors or missing password are refused
                 and the .pkt files are renamed to .bad
<strong>UplMgr program   </strong>The name of the Areamgr program of this node.
                 (This doesn't work yet).
<strong>UplMgr passwd    </strong>The password for the Areamgr of this node.
<strong>Mail forward     </strong>Not in use yet.
<strong>ARCmail comp.    </strong>Use ARCmail 0.60 file naming convention for out of zone mail.
<strong>ARCmail a..z     </strong>Allow a..z last character for ARCmail filenames.

<H3>Mail groups</H3>
<P>
Here you can tag which mail groups are available for this node. Note that all
groups are visible here, even for networks this node has no aka's in. Be 
carefull not to allow a node to connect areas from networks he has no aka in.

<H3>File groups</H3>

The same story as for mail groups is true for the file groups.

<H3>Statistics</H3>
<P>
In this statistics screen you can see the mail and files flow with this
node. Values are stored for the current week, the previous week, the
current month and previous month and the overall total since you defined
this node. There are actual 12 months of statistics stored in the nodes
record, only 2 are visible.
