<H1>MBSE BBS Setup - archiver programs</H1>
<P>
To process mail, files and test new uploads you need archivers to process those
files. For each (un)archiver you must setup the full path and filename and
commandline switches. Archivers and unarchivers may be different programs such
as <strong>zip</strong> and <strong>unzip</strong>.<p>
There is a little 
difference in processing mail and files, mail will always work on the same
directory, while for ticfile processing the archives can contain subdirectories.
So it is obvious that for rearchiving a file you need the recursive
switches to keep the directory structure within an archive as it was.<P>
There is also a special command to replace a banner in an archive. This is when
you receive files with the banner of your uplink in it and you want to replace
it with the add of your own bbs and you don't want to mess with the files in
the archive. <P>
The last option is to extract the file FILE_ID.DIZ from the 
archive, this can be used for file description when the file is imported in
your bbs. To make life a little more easy, during the first bbs setup the most
common archivers already configured. You only need to make sure that they are
really present on your system.
