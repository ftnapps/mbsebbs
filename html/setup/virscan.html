<H1>MBSE BBS Setup - virus scanners</H1>
<P>
Once upon a time there was no DOS and no computer virusses. But since DOS was
invented as a small OS which was easily extensible, virus writers saw their
chance to easy spread their hacks. Although running a Linux system is 
relative safe, most of the files that you have available on your bbs 
are DOS based programs. And before you put them available for download, they 
should be checked for virusses. Macro virusses are a relative new danger,
this can also hurt Unix/Linux users.<P>
There are several scanners for Linux available. Default only two of them
are setup. You may consult <A HREF="http://www.openantivirus.org/">
http://www.openantivirus.org</A> for more scanner mentioned in a mini-FAQ 
maintained by Rainer Link.
<p>
<b>NAI Virus Scan</b> (uvscan) for Unix (Linux) made by <A HREF="http://www.nai.com">
Network Associates, USA.</A>
Not free for personal use. Uses the same DAT files as for Windows and DOS.
<P>
<strong>AntiVir/Linux</strong> made by <A HREF="http://www.hbedv.com">
H+BEDV Datentechnik GmbH.</A>
Can also be installed in sendmail or Postfix to scan incoming
and outgoing email. This may be a good idea if you run a email gateway. 
This version can be registered for personal use.
<P>
As soon as you have made a scanner available in the setup and you receive files
in tic areas where the scan flag is set, then these files will be checked.
As soon as one of the scanners detects a virus the received file will not be imported.
Uploads from users will be checked with the installed virus scanners as well.
