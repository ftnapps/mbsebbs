<H3>Introduction.</H3>
<P>
Hatch files is nothing more than entering a new file into a file echo. That
file is searched for on your system in a specific directory with a certain
filemask. This can be for example a new created nodelist or an allfiles listing.
Everytime <strong>mbfido tic</strong> is run it will scan for files defined
in this setup. If such a file is found, a special .tic file is written and 
stored in the mailers inbound directory. When the <strong>mbfido</strong>
starts processing .tic files, that new hatched file will be processed as if
it was received form another system. To let this work, you obviously need
an existing TIC area.
