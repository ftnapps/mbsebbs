<H1>mbdiff - Nodelist difference file processor.</H1>
<P>

<H3>Synopsis.</H3>
<P>
<code><strong>mbdiff</strong> [nodelist] [nodediff] &lt;options&gt;</code>
<P>&nbsp;<P>

<H3>Description.</H3>
<P>
<strong>mbdiff</strong> applies a (compressed) nodediff file against the
nodelist of the week before to create a new nodelist. The result is a new
plain nodelist and a nodelist compressed with zip.
<P>&nbsp;<P>

<H3>Environmet.</H3>
<P>
In order to run <strong>mbdiff</strong> you must set the global variable
<strong>$MBSE_ROOT</strong>. This variable must point to the root directory
of the bbs structure. The main configuration file <strong>config.data</strong>
must be present in the ~/etc directory.
<P>&nbsp;<P>

<H3>Commands.</H3>
<P>
<code><strong>mbdiff</strong> [nodelist] [nodediff]</code> The nodelist must be the full
path and filename without the dot and daynumber extension. The nodediff is
the full path and filename to the (compressed) nodediff file fitting on the
latest nodelist. It is adviced to make a seperate working directory where
you keep the nodelists. Don't do this in your normal nodelist directory.
When the operation is successfull, the new nodelist is in the working directory
and the old list is removed. A compressed version of the nodelist is also
placed in the working directory. From here you can hatch the new compressed
nodelist with the <strong>mbfido</strong> program.
<P>&nbsp;<P>

<H3>Options.</H3>
<P>
<code><strong>-quiet</strong></code> - supress screen output, this switch is needed when
<strong>mbdiff</strong> runs on the background.
