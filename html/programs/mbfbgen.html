<P>

<H3>Synopsis.</H3>
<P>
<code><strong>mbfbgen</strong></code>
<P>&nbsp;<P>

<H3>Description.</H3>
<P>
<strong>mbfbgen</strong> is used to import filebase areas from CD-ROM. This
util works like <strong>fbgen</strong> which is known to RA users. It reads
the file <strong>files.bbs</strong> to get the filenames and descriptions
to build the filedatabase.
<P>
To import a filebase you must setup the area with <strong>mbsetup</strong>.
If you are really importing from a CD that will stay mounted on your system
you must set <strong>CDrom</strong> to yes. If the files.bbs file is not in the
directory were the files are, but somewere else on the CD, you must fill in
the field <strong>Files.bbs</strong> in the edit file area screen.
If the files.bbs file is in the same directory together with the files, you may
leave that field blank.
It is handy to use a closed range of file areas.
Once you are ready with the setup start <strong>mbfbgen</strong>, enter the
start and end area numbers, the uploader name, and the import will start.
This can last quite long as from each file the 32 bits CRC is calculated
that will be stored in the filedatabase. When <strong>mbfbgen</strong> is
finished, run <strong>mbfile index</strong> to recreate the filerequest index
file.

<H3>Environmet.</H3>
<P>
In order to run <strong>fbgen</strong> you must set the global variable
<strong>$MBSE_ROOT</strong>. This variable must point to the root directory
of the bbs structure. The main configuration file <strong>config.data</strong>
must be present in the ~/etc directory.
