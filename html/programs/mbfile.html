<H3>Synopsys.</H3>
<code><strong>mbfile</strong> [commands] &lt;options&gt;</code>
<P>&nbsp;<P>

<H3>Description.</H3>
<P>
<strong>mbfile</strong>
is the filedatabase maintenance program for mbsebbs. In order to run mbfile you
must have started <strong>mbsed</strong>,
this is the deamon which controls all bbs activities.
<P>
The main purpose of <strong>mbfile</strong>
to do automatic maintenance on the downloadable files on the bbs, such as
removing or moving old files, checking the database and packing the database.
The best way to do the maintenance is to run <strong>mbfile</strong>
from the crontab. example:
<P><pre>
30 05 * * * export MBSE_ROOT=/opt/mbse; /opt/mbse/bin/mbfile kill pack check index -quiet
</pre>
<P>&nbsp;<P>

<H3>Environment.</H3>
<P>
In order to run the bbs you need to set one global environment variable
<strong>$MBSE_ROOT</strong>
This variable must point to the root of the bbs directoy structure. The
main configuration file <strong>config.data</strong>
must exist in the subdirectory ~/etc.
<P>&nbsp;<P>

<H3>Commands.</H3>
<P>
<code><strong>mbfile</strong> adopt &lt;area&gt; &lt;file&gt; [description]</code>
Adopt a file to the filebase. The description is optional, but if present it
should be enclosed in quotes. The optional description may be 255 characters.
Default mbfile will try to use the FILE_ID.DIZ if this is present. The file to
adopt needs to be in your current directory and will be copied to the new area.
If you have virus scanners defined, the file will be checked for virusses. 

<P>
<code><strong>mbfile</strong> check</code>
Check the database integrity. All files in the filedatabase must exist on
disk and all files on disk must exist in the filedatabase. There are some
exceptions, files.bbs, files.bak, 00index, index*.html, header, readme and 
files that start with a dot. 
Of all files the date and time is checked, the size and the crc
value of the file. If there is something wrong, the error is corrected or the
file is removed. If the area is a CD-rom area, the check that files on disk
must exist in the filedatabase is skipped.
<P>

<code><strong>mbfile</strong> import &lt;area&gt;</code>
Import files to the given area using files.bbs descriptions. 
You need to be in the area where the files are stored. 
There must also be the files.bbs file present, if not then in the area setup
you must enter the full filename and path where the files.bbs is. This may
be needed for some CD-roms where the files.bbs is not in the same directory
as where the files are. The files are not checked for FILE_ID.DIZ inside the
archives. If you have virus scanners defined, the files are checked for 
virussed before the are added the the bbs.
<P>

<code><strong>mbfile</strong> index</code>
Create fast filerequest index for the <strong>mbcico</strong> filerequest
processor. In each directory with the downloadable files is also a 
<strong>files.bbs</strong> file written is msdos cr/lf format. This includes a
download counter.
Also, if defined, in each available download area for ftp/http, index files are
created, starting at the ftp pub directory.
<P>

<code><strong>mbfile</strong> kill</code>
Delete or move files in areas that have the <strong>download age</strong>
set or the <strong>filedate age</strong> set. A setting of 0 is ignored.
Areas on CD-rom are always skipped.
If the Move to Area option is set the files are moved to the given area. The
upload date and download date are reset to the current date and time.
So if you set in the destination area aging of 14 days, files will stay
there for 14 days after the move. This is good for automatic "last chance" areas.
<P>

<code><strong>mbfile</strong> list [area]</code>
List all defined file areas, the number of files, the total size of the files
and the primary group. If and area is given on the commandline, the files in
that area are listed.

<P>
<code><strong>mbfile</strong> move &lt;from&gt; &lt;to&gt; &lt;file&gt;</code>
This command will move a file from one area to another. No actions on the file
are performed.

<P>
<code><strong>mbfile</strong> pack</code>
This command will actualy remove the records of files that are marked for
deletion. If the file is still on disk, it will be removed also. So when
you delete files with mbsetup, they are still in your database and on disk
until you run <strong>mbfile pack</strong>.
<P>&nbsp;<P>

<H3>Options.</H3>
<P>
<code><strong>mbfile</strong> [command] -quiet</code>
Quiet mode, no screen output. Use this switch if you run <strong>mbfile</strong> from the crontab.
<P>
<code><strong>mbfile</strong> [command] -announce</code>
Announce mode, use this switch with the adopt and import commands to prevent
that the added file(s) will be announced. This can be usefull if you add lots of
files that you don't want to announce these as new files.
<P>

<H3>Setup.</H3>
<P>
In <strong>mbsetup</strong> menu 1.16 you need to set the public FTP base
and the maximum security level.
