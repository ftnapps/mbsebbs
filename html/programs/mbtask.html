<P>

<H3>Sysopsis.</H3>
<P>
<code><strong>mbtask</strong></code>
<P>&nbsp;<P>

<H3>Description.</H3>
<P>
<strong>mbtask</strong> is the taskmanager for the whole MBSE BBS system.
This deamon keeps track of all client actions,
does the logging for the clients, does database locking, authorizes clients,
set/resets users "do not disturb flags", sends and receives chat messages,
keeps track of Zone Mail Hour, the status of the mail and files in the outbound,
and the BBS open/close status. 
Communication between <strong>mbsed</strong> and the client programs is done via Unix
Datagram sockets. The protocol used to communicate between <strong>mbtask</strong>
and the clients is explained later.
This daemon also watches the semafore directory for some special files. 
It also starts programs when they are needed. 
The very first time <b>mbtask</b> is started it creates a default config.data and task.data,
the main configuration and task configuration files. 
Then it calls <b>mbsetup init</b> to build the default databases.
<b>mbtask</b> should be started at system boot so the bbs system will start working. 
The init script that is installed on your system will do that. 
<P>
After startup and initalization <b>mbtask</b> runs internally once per second forever. 
If there is nothing to do then this time will slowly increase upto 5 seconds. This time will be reset
to one second as soon as there is work to be done. The actual work is to check a number of external and
internal semafore's and act on these. 
But before any program is started a number of things are checked:
<OL>
  <LI>Check the system's load average. If it is too busy the processing of background 
      tasks is suspended until your system load drops. 
      The default setup is set at 1.50 but you can change that with mbsetup. Experience
      will learn what the best value will be and I need some feedback on that.<br>
  <LI>The UPS semafore <b>upsalarm</b> will be checked. This means that the system is running on
      battery power and no new jobs are started. 
  <LI>The UPS semafore <b>upsdown</b> will be checked. This is the fatal one, if
      this one exists <b>mbtask</b> will try to stop all current running jobs.
      If there are no jobs left running then <b>mbtask</b> will stop itself. 
      The upsdown semafore means that the system 
      will shutdown and power off, that's why it's fatal and there is no way back.<br>
  <LI>The status of the bbs will be checked, is it open or closed. If it is closed, no
      jobs will be started.
  <LI>The Zone Mail Hour is checked. If ZMH begins the semafore's <b>zmh</b> is
      created.
      If ZMH ends the semafore <b>zmh</b> is removed. 
  <LI>Each twenty seconds a ping is send to the IP addresses defined with <b>mbsetup</b> to
      check if the internet can be reached. If both ping addresses fail, it is assumed that
      the internet can't be reached. After a status change, the outbound will be
      scanned.
  <LI>Scan the mailer outbound for work. This builds a list of nodes with mail
      in the outbound and sets the necessary flags on nodes who may be called.
      If a node needs to be called, <b>mbtask</b> will spawn <b>mbcico</b> to
      call this node. The number of free modem and ISDN ports and the maximum
      number of TCP/IP sessions and already registered sessions, determine
      howmany sessions will be started. The sessions will be started at
      intervals of 20 seconds.
      It will also set a time when something will change for a node, ie. a zone
      mail hour is reached, or a mail window for a node with Txx flags is
      reached. Internally this scheduler runs at the UTC clock because Fidonet
      has all times defined in UTC.
</OL>
Each new minute the timestamp of semafore <b>mbtask.last</b> is updated so that you can check that
<b>mbtask</b> is running. Also each minute is checked if the system configuration files are
changed, is so they are reloaded. There is no need to stop and start <b>mbtask</b> if you made
changes to the system configuration.
Then all kind of internal semafore's will be checked. The commands that are executed have default
values, but they can be changed wit mbsetup. The commands can be scripts as well.
The checks and actions are:

<P>
The Fast and Slow values mean: Fast is each second, Slow is check each 20 seconds.
As you can see, the system will not do too much at the same time. Jobs like compiling
new nodelists or create file request indexes have a very low priority. Because this
daemon checks the semafore's each second it responds much better that the old scripts
running on the cron daemon. The system will be expanded so that more outgoing calls
will be done at the same time, ie. ISDN and analogue calls, and if they are present
internet calls, will be made at the same time.
<P>
The <b>mbtask</b> program keeps also track of a unique number generator, this is
just a simple counter that is increased each time it is asked for a new number.
It will take years for the numbers to repeat. Even if the status file is lost
the chance that numbers are repeated on your system are almost zero. The first
time the counter is initialized it is set to the current unix time in seconds
since 1 januari 1970. This counter is used by several programs to create unique
.pkt filenames, msgid numbers etc.
<P>&nbsp;<P>

<H3>Environment.</H3>
<P>
In order to run <strong>mbtask</strong> you must set the global variable
<strong>$MBSE_ROOT</strong>. This variable must point to the root directory
of the bbs structure.
<P>&nbsp;<P>


<H3>Security.</H3>
<P>
<strong>mbtask</strong> is installed setuid root. This is needed to initialize
a raw socket for the ping function. After that is done the privilege drops to
user <strong>mbse</strong> before the child process is created and the rest
of the initialisation is done. 
The child process can never get root privileges because it is spawned by user mbse.
<P>&nbsp;<P>


<H3>Communications.</H3>
<P>
Communication between the server and the clients is established by
Unix datagram sockets. There can be only 1 server running. 
The server will accept connections from clients on your local machine only.
The limit for the amount of clients that can connect to the server is set to 100.
<P>
The server creates a Unix datagram socket at startup and waits for connections.
The name of this this socket is /opt/mbse/tmp/mbtask.
When a client connects it creates a Unix datagram socket in /opt/mbse/tmp, the name is
the name of the program, added with the pid of the program. So if <b>mbcico</b> is started 
with pid 2312 the socket will be /opt/mbse/tmp/mbcico2312.
<P>
All commands are 4 capital letters followed by a colon, a number indicating
how much data fields will follow. If that number is higher than zero, the 
data fields are seperated with commas. The command is terminated 
with a ; character. Examples are:<br>
<pre>
GCLO:0;                 Zero datafields command.
DOPE:1,dbname;          One datafield command.
</pre>
All commands will receive a reply as soon as possible. If a
resource is temporary not available, a reply will follow too, telling
this condition. Replies can also contain optional data. Examples:<br>
<pre>
100:0;                  Response 100, no data.
200:1,Syntax error;     One datafield.
</pre>
The server has a 10 minute timeout for receiving data when a connection
is established. The clients need to "ping" the server at regular intervals
to prevent a disconnect. All official MBSE BBS programs do that. The pid
send with most commands is the pid of the calling program. Since this number
is unique, it is used to keep track of the connected clients.
<P>
The commands are divided in 26 catagories, most unused at this time.

</pre>
Note: in reply of GDST the reply is 100:n,size free mountpoint fstype,.....
where n = 1 for 1 filesystem, and 10 for a total of 10 filesystems. There
will never be a reply for more then 10 filesystems. The reported filesystems
are retrieved from /etc/mtab which is the actual mountstatus. On FreeBSD and
NetBSD a system call is used to get the information about the mounted
filesystem.
This is used by the <b>mbmon</b> program to get a "live" view of your filesystems.
