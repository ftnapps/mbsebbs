<H1>mbpasswd - The password wrapper.</H1>
<P>

<H3>Synopsis.</h3>
<P>
<code><strong>mbpasswd</strong> [-opt] [username] [password]</code>
<P>&nbsp;<P>

<H3>Description.</h3>
<P>
<strong>mbpasswd</strong> is the wrapper for the <strong>passwd</strong> program
is present on all Linux systems. To use <b>passwd</b> to change the password of 
another user is only allowed by <b>root</b>. The mbpasswd program overcomes this limitation.
The wrapper <b>mbpasswd</b> is run from the bbs by user <b>mbse</b> when an ordinary 
user is logged in the bbs. The program is called when a new user logs in the bbs or 
when an existing user changes his password. His password under Unix is then always the same as his
password in the bbs program. This is necessary for the user to be able to get
his email using the pop3 protocol.<P> 
You never need to run <strong>mbpasswd</strong> by hand, in fact it is protected so that only
members of group <b>bbs</b> are allowed to use it.
<P>&nbsp;<P>

<H3>Environment.</H3>
<P>
<strong>mbpasswd</strong> must be installed setuid root and setgid root, ls -la looks like this:<br>
<pre>
-rws--s--x   1 root     root         6644 Jun 26 21:23 /opt/mbse/bin/mbpasswd*
</pre>
<P>&nbsp;<P>

<H3>Commands.</H3>
<P>
<code><strong>mbpasswd</strong> [-opt] [username] [password]</code> for example:<br>
<pre>
mbpasswd -f michiel secret
</pre>
Valid options are <strong>-f</strong> (forced), this will also change locked passwords,
this has only effect if your system uses shadow passwords. If you use
<strong>-n</strong> as option, locked passwords cannot be changed. For a new user the
<b>-f</b> option is used by <b>mbsebbs</b>, when a user changes his own password the
<b>-n</b> option is used.
