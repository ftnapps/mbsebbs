<div align="center"><h1>Upgrade MBSE BBS</h1></div>

<h3>Introduction.</h3>
<p>
First of all, if you upgrade from a previous version of MBSE BBS, 
read all the ChangeLog entries from the version you are currently 
running upto the new @VERSION@ version you are installing. 
Then make a backup of at least all files in /opt/mbse/bin and /opt/mbse/etc.
<p>&nbsp;<P>


<h3>Install the source.</h3>
<p>
Login as user <b>mbse</b>. Yes, very important, <b>login as user mbse</b>.
While in mbse's home directory (/opt/mbse) unpack the distribution archives:
<pre>
tar xfvj /path/to/mbsebbs-@VERSION@.tar.bz2
</pre>
You now have the subdirectory with sources in the right place. 
Next build the binaries and install them using the following commands:
<pre>
cd ~/mbsebbs-@VERSION@
make clean
./configure
make
su        <b>important, do not use "su -"</b>
password: <em>enter root password here</em>
make install
</pre>
Ubuntu users should do:
<pre>
cd ~/mbsebbs-@VERSION@
make clean
./configure
make
sudo make install
</pre>
The last part of the installation procedure shows you the location of the bbs
startup script that is added to your system. Remember this one for a moment.
<p>
Now restart the bbs (still as root) by executing the startup
script you just saw on the screen followed by a space and the word <b>reload</b> or <b>restart</b>,
this depends on the distribution you use. There are also distributions that must use the startup
script twice, once with <b>stop</b> and then <b>start</b> as parameter.
For example:
<pre>
/etc/rc.d/init.d/mbsed reload
exit
</pre>
Ubuntu users do:
<pre>
sudo /etc/init.d/mbsebbs restart
</pre>
This will close the bbs, kill <b>mbtask</b>, start the new <b>mbtask</b> and open
the bbs again for use. At this point you may need to update some configuration settings
with <b>mbsetup</b>. Read the ChangeLog for the details. The ChangeLog may also describe a
different restart procedure if this is needed.
<p>&nbsp;<p>

<h3>Other updates</h3>
<p>
Not everything is updated during the upgrade, only the binaries. Normally this is enough. 
However it may be that the example menus, macro templates are updated in the distribution.
Because these files may have some very personal changes, these files are not overwritten.
You can force that, in the subdirectory ~/mbsebbs-@VERSION@/examples type
<pre>
make help
</pre>
to see what you can force to update. But carefully taking over the changes may be better.
<br>
In the directory /opt/mbse/bin and /opt/mbse/etc are new scripts installed. They have the
extension <b>.new</b> and you need to examine these to see if you can simply copy these over
your current ones.
