<h3>Installing the BBS.</h3>
<p>
Now you have shell scripts in ~/etc, most of them are called by cron, some
are called during system startup and shutdown. You also have some default
configuration files, these are ttyinfo, modems, fidonet networks. In the
default (english) directory you now have default menu datafiles and ansi
screens. These are copies of my test system so you have to edit them to
build your own bbs.<br>
Editing ansi screens can be done on a Linux system with <strong>duhdraw</strong>, 
this is available from 2:280/2802 as <strong>duhdraw.tgz</strong> (68 Kbytes). 
The binaries are included in this archive, if you compile it yourself 
it may give trouble so if the binaries work, use these.<br>
Another editor is available from 
<A HREF="http://www.drastic.net/bmdraw/">http://www.drastic.net/bmdraw/</A>,
you can find the tar.gz file in <A HREF="http://www.drastic.net/bmdraw/files/bmd022.tgz">
http://www.drastic.net/bmdraw/files/bmd022.tgz</A>, it's about 36 Kbytes. 
This is also a thedraw clone for Linux. Note, at my system I needed to run it as root.<br>
You may also want to edit ~/etc/header.txt and ~/etc/footer.txt, these
files are the top and bottom of the newfiles/allfiles listings.

<p>
<h3>the next step.</h3>
<p>
The next step is the <a href="setup/index.htm">setup</a> of the bbs.
