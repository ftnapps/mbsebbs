<h3>Introduction.</h3>
<p>
Before you compile and install MBSE BBS you must first setup the basic
environment. If you don't do this, things will fail.
<p>
To compile and install MBSE BBS most distributions have installed all needed packages. 
If important packages are missing then the configure script will tell you. There are also
less important packages which if missinng still let you compile MBSE BBS, but you will miss
some features. Here is a short list of these packages:
<ol>
 <li><b>Zlib</b>. On some distributions you also need <b>zlib development</b>. When you have
     zlib installed, then in <b>mbcico</b> extra code will be compiled in the Hydra and Binkp protocol drivers
     that will allow the PLZ extension. In the binkp protocol GZ compression will be enabled as well.</li>
 <li><b>Bzlib</b>. On some distributions you need to install <b>bzlib2 development</b> to add 
     support for binkp BZ2 compression.</li>
</ol>
<P>&nbsp;<p>

<h3>Step 1: planning the filesystems.</h3>
<p>
MBSE BBS is default installed in <b>/opt/mbse</b>. The default filesystem
layout looks like this:<br>

</pre>
<p>
Don't use UMSDOS or SAMBA filesystems for the bbs, stick by the standard
GNU/Linux
filesystems (ext2, ext3 or reiserfs) or ufs if you use FreeBSD.
If you intent to make your bbs also accessible
by FTP and WWW you must create the directory structure under the ftp user
behind the pub directory. Read <a href="misc/ftpserver.html">the
ftp server</a> doc for details. If you don't follow these guidlines, you
will run into trouble later and have to spend a lot of time in correcting
this error.
<P>&nbsp;<p>

<h3>Step 2: Running the installation script.</h3>
<p>
First, if you use FreeBSD, install the psmisc package. This will make sure
that MBSE BBS is stopped properly if you shutdown your computer. Also if you 
use FreeBSD 5.0 or later make sure that you mount procfs, see <b>man procfs</b>
for details. If you don't mount procfs, you cannot add new users to the bbs and
existing bbs users cannot change their passwords. As sysop, you can't change
passwords too.<br>
If you are upgrading, proceed with step 4. If not, follow the next steps
very carefully!<br>
The installation script must be run by root. It checks if there is a
previous or failed installation on your system. If that's so the script will
not run. In other words, you can only run this script once. The script makes
backup copies of the system files it changes, these files will get the
extension <strong>.mbse</strong> To run the installation script you need
the archive <strong>mbbsebbs-@VERSION@.tar.bz2</strong>.
Unpack this archive on your system, in /tmp:
<pre>
cd /tmp
tar xfvj /path/to/the/mbsebbs-@VERSION@.tar.bz2
</pre>
To start the script type:
<pre>
cd mbsebbs-@VERSION@
bash ./SETUP.sh
</pre>
Yes, use <b>bash</b> as shell here. On some systems root doesn't use  bash
as login shell, calling the script with bash forces the use of bash.
The script does the following:
<ol>
 <li>Create the group <strong>bbs</strong>
 <li>Create the user <strong>mbse</strong>
 <li>Create a <strong>.profile</strong> for user <strong>mbse</strong>
 <li>Create and set owner of directory tree under /opt/mbse
</ol>
Then the script will ask you to give a password for user <strong>mbse</strong>
This password is for system maintenance and for you to make changes to the
bbs. You will need that frequently but you should not make that password
easy to guess of course. The script will then continue again:
<ol start="5">
 <li>The user <strong>bbs</strong> is added.
 <li>The password will be removed from user <strong>bbs</strong> This action
will make changes in /etc/shadow (if you have that) otherwise in /etc/passwd.
On FreeBSD it uses other tools to modify the master database.
On NetBSD you have to do that manually, there are no tools to do that.
 <li>If they don't exist in the file /etc/services the services fido, tfido
and binkp will be added. 
 <li>If they don't exist in the file /etc/inetd.conf the internet protocols
for the mailer will be added. The <strong>inetd</strong> is restarted to
activate the changes. If your distribution uses xinetd instead of inetd, an
include file for xinetd is added instead.
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;<p>

<h3>Step 3: Check the basic installation</h3>
<p>
The last screen of the script is about sanity checks. Perform those checks!
If something is wrong, now is the time to fix it. Don't panic and remember
the backups of the system files that are changed are in /etc with the 
extension <strong>.mbse</strong> i.e: those were the original files.
The installation logfile is copied to /opt/mbse.
If everythings is allright, then remove the directory /tmp/mbsebbs-@VERSION@:
<pre>
cd /tmp
rm -Rf mbsebbs-@VERSION@
</pre>
<p>&nbsp;<p>

<h3>Step 4: Install the basic packages.</h3>
<p>
Login as user <b>mbse</b>. Yes, very important, <b>login as user mbse</b>.
While in mbse's home directory (/opt/mbse) unpack the distribution archives:
<pre>
tar xfvj /path/to/mbsebbs-@VERSION@.tar.bz2
</pre>
You now have the subdirectory with sources in the right place. 
Next build the binaries and install them using the following commands:
<pre>
cd ~/mbsebbs-@VERSION@
./configure [--enable-optimize] [--enable-newsgate] [--enable-gdkdel]
make
su        <b>important, do not use "su -"</b>
password: <em>enter root password here</em>
make install
exit
</pre>
<b>Important:</b> it seems logical to use the <code>--enable-newsgate</code> option
but it isn't. When you do, the mbnntp program is disabled and you cannot serve
echomail as news to your users via internet. But you can gate echomail to the
internet. Independant of your choice, you can allways make internet news available 
for your bbs users. Only use --enable-newsgate if you really need to gate echomail
to the internet.
<p>
To support Chinese the DELete key needs to be changed because it conflicts with one
of the characters. If you want to use Chinese, use <code>--enable-gbkdel</code>
to configure.
<p>
The last part of the installation procedure shows you the location of the bbs
startup script that is added to your system. Remember this one for a moment.
Because this is your first
time installation, example menus and example textfiles are installed. 
If they already exist on your systems (when you do an upgrade) they
will not be installed again.
<p>
Now start the bbs for the first time (still as root) by executing the startup
script you just saw on the screen followed by a space and the word <b>start</b>.
For example:
<pre>
/etc/rc.d/init.d/mbsed start
</pre>
This will start the <b>mbtask</b> daemon.
After that the bbs will be opened for use.
Check the file <b>/opt/mbse/log/mbtask.log</b> for startup problems.
The first time <b>mbtask</b> is started on your system it will create a 
lot of new configuration files with default settings.
<p>&nbsp;<p>

<h3>Step 5: Ready.</h3>
<p>
Now you have shell scripts in ~/etc, most of them are called by cron, some
are called during system startup and shutdown. You also have some default
configuration files, these are ttyinfo, modems, fidonet networks. In the
default (english) directory you now have default menu datafiles and ansi
screens. These are copies of my test system so you have to edit them to
build your own bbs.<br>
Editing ansi screens can be done on a GNU/Linux system with one of the
following packages:
<ol>
 <li><strong>duhdraw</strong>, this is available from 2:280/2802 as 
     <strong>duhdraw.tgz</strong> (68 Kbytes). 
     The binaries are included in this archive, if you compile it yourself 
     it may give trouble so if the binaries work, use these.</li>
 <li><strong>bmdraw</strong> This editor is available from 
     <A HREF="http://www.drastic.net/bmdraw/">http://www.drastic.net/bmdraw/</A>,
     you can find the tar.gz file in 
     <A HREF="http://www.drastic.net/bmdraw/files/bmd022.tgz">http://www.drastic.net/bmdraw/files/bmd022.tgz</A>, 
     it's about 36 Kbytes. This is also a thedraw clone for Linux. 
     Note, at my system I needed to run it as root.</li>
 <li><strong>TetraDraw</strong> This is a very nice Ansi editor, you can
     get this file as TETR~VC#.TGZ from 2:280/2802. The file is 157 Kbytes.
</ol>
You may also want to edit ~/etc/header.txt and ~/etc/footer.txt, these
files are the top and bottom of the newfiles/allfiles listings.
<P>
Now the basic environment is finished, the next thing to do is
<a href="setup/index.htm">configure the bbs</a>.
