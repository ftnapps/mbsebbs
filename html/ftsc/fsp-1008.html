Status of this document
-----------------------

  This document is a Fidonet Standards Proposal (FSP).

  This document specifies an optional Fidonet standard protocol for
  the Fidonet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
  improvements.

  This document is released to the public domain, and may be used,
  copied or modified for any purpose whatever.

  This revision is an update to FRL-0092.001. The basic specifications
  are unchanged.


Abstract
--------

  Most fidonet message editors offer a "forward" function. Using this
  function a user A ("forwarder") can sort of "redirect" a message
  from user B ("author") to another user C ("final recipient"), maybe
  because the forwarder is not the correct recipient, or because the
  final recipient is a better person to answer the message. The name
  and address of the author are usually included in the forward in
  free-text format. The message text is included in non-quoted format.

  A problem arises when the final recipient wants to reply to the
  author of the forwarded message. The forward contains the forwarder
  as the sender. So the final recipient must insert the name and
  address of the author manually, using the information contained in
  the message text. The message editor of the final recipient can't do
  this automatically because of the free-text format. The editor will
  also use incorrect quote initials, which is at least irritating.

  This document introduces 7 new control lines which contain the
  header information of the original message. With these control lines
  the message editor can use the original header information
  automatically.


1. Specifications
-----------------

  There are 7 new control lines: FWDFROM, FWDTO, FWDORIG, FWDDEST,
  FWDSUBJ, FWDAREA, FWDMSGID. As all control lines they start with an
  ASCII 01 character (SOH) followed by the control line name followed
  by whitespace followed by the control line's content followed by
  ASCII 13 (CR).

  Please note that all these control lines do not have a colon (like
  the control lines in FTS-0001). This would be just waste of space.

  FWDFROM
  -------

  This control line contains the name of the original sender as found
  in the FROM field of the original message. Leading and trailing
  whitespace should be removed. This control line should be omitted
  altogether if the FROM field is empty.

  FWDTO
  -----

  This control line contains the name of the original recipient as
  found in the TO field of the original message. Leading and trailing
  whitespace should be removed. This control line should be omitted
  altogether if the TO field is empty.

  FWDORIG
  -------

  This control line contains the address of the original sender as
  found in the ORIG field of the original message. The usual 5D ASCII
  notation (zone:net/node.point@domain) should be used. This control
  line should be omitted altogether if the address is not known.

  FWDDEST
  -------

  This control line contains the address of the original recipient as
  found in the DEST field of the original message. The usual 5D ASCII
  notation (zone:net/node.point@domain) should be used. This control
  line should be omitted altogether if the address is not known or
  unsure (as it is the case with forwarded echomail messages).

  FWDSUBJ
  -------

  This control line contains the subject line of the original message.
  This control line should be omitted altogether if the SUBJ field is
  empty.

  This control line should by made optional for security reasons. Echo
  manager passwords are too easily revealed with it.

  FWDAREA
  -------

  This control line contains the name of the echomail area where the
  original message was forwarded from. It should be omitted altogether
  if the original message was not forwarded from an echomail area.

  FWDMSGID
  --------

  This control line contains the MSGID control line of the original
  message. It should be omitted altogether if a MSGID control line is
  not present in the original message.


2. Usage
--------

  When the "forward" function of the message editor is invoked, the
  editor program should generate the proposed control lines from the
  header of the original message. If the original message already was
  a forwarded one (indicated by the presence of at least a FWDORIG
  control line), the editor should keep all FWD* control lines and
  should not add any FWD* control lines. This preserves the FWD*
  control lines of the first forwarder, containing the header data of
  the author of the original message.

  The editor should not generate FWD* control lines, if the message
  isn't to be forwarded. A mail forwarding robot may also generate
  these control lines, if it not just readdresses the message.

  When the "reply" function of the editor is invoked the program
  should use the control lines' contents instead of the header
  information. The control lines should not be included in the reply.

  Since it may not be immediately clear whether the user wants to
  reply to the forwarder or to the original sender, the editor should
  offer a means to ignore the proposed control lines and start a
  "normal" reply instead, e.g. by two distinct functions, by user
  preference or a dialog.


  Pseudo code:

  forwarding_message:
     if is_forwarded_message then
        don't change FWD* control lines
     else
        add FWD* control lines

  quoting_message:
     if is_forwarded_message then
        if reply_to_forwarder then
           use header data (normal quoting)
        else
           use FWD* control lines
        remove FWD* control lines from reply
     else
        use header data (normal quoting)

  other_functions:
     remove/ignore FWD* control lines


  Example:

  Message from Joe User to my boss node:

     From: Joe User 1:234/567
     To:   Harry Herrmannsdoerfer 2:2490/2520
     Subj: Some questions
     @MSGID: 1:234/567 12345678
     Text: Hello Harry!
           ...

  Harry forwards the message to me:

     From: Harry Herrmannsdoerfer 2:2490/2520
     To:   Michael Hohner 2:2490/2520.17
     Subj: Joe's message
     @FWDFROM Joe User
     @FWDORIG 1:234/567
     @FWDTO Harry Herrmannsdoerfer
     @FWDDEST 2:2490/2520
     @FWDSUBJ Some questions
     @FWDMSGID 1:234/567 12345678
     Text: Hi Michael!
           ...

  My answer using the new control lines:

     From: Michael Hohner 2:2490/2520.17
     To:   Joe User 1:234/567
     Subj: Some questions
     @REPLY: 1:234/567 12345678
     Text: Hi Joe!

3. Compatiblity
---------------

  Editor programs which are not prepared for these proposed control
  lines usually just ignore them and remove them from a reply. A reply
  goes to the forwarder. Nothing gained and nothing lost.


4. Known implementations
------------------------

  This proposal is implemented in the author's Fidonet editor
  "FleetStreet for OS/2" (versions 1.17 and newer).

  Also implemented in Odinn Sorensens Fidonet editor "GoldED"
  (versions 3.00.Alpha5 and newer).
