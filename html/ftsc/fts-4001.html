2. General
----------

  The general control paragraph format is specified in separate FTSC
  documents.

  The addressing control paragraphs specified in this document are
  normally only used in netmail messages and not in echomail messages.

  While it would be technically correct to use them also in echomail,
  it is known that certain programs will misbehave if they are present
  there. It is therefore recommended that they should not be used in
  echomail at the present time.

  If a program processing messages detects these control paragraphs in
  an echomail message it is recommended that they are disregarded and
  deleted from any copies of that message exported to other systems.

  Addressing of and address resolution for echomail messages should
  instead be done with the help of packet and message header
  information. See separate FTSC documents.

  To determine the address of the original sender of an echomail
  message, the information in the Origin line should be used. See
  separate FTSC documents.


3. FMPT
-------

  The FMPT control paragraph shall be used to give information about
  the point number of the original sender of a message if that point
  number is not 0. If the point number of the original sender of a
  message is 0 that message should not contain any FMPT control
  paragraph.

  The format of a FMPT control paragraph shall be:

    &lt;SOH&gt;"FMPT &lt;point number&gt;"&lt;CR&gt;

  where &lt;point number&gt; is the ASCII representation of the point number
  of the sender. The point number shall be an unsigned integer in the
  range 1-65535.

  E.g. a message from point number 1 of a certain node shall contain
  the following FMPT control paragraph

    &lt;SOH&gt;"FMPT 1"&lt;CR&gt;

  Note that the format of a FMPT control paragraph deviates from the
  general format specified in separate FTSC documents in that it does
  not contain any colon after the control tag.


4. TOPT
-------

  The TOPT control paragraph shall be used to give information about
  the point number of the ultimate addressee of a message if that
  point number is not 0. If the point number of the ultimate addressee
  of a message is 0 that message should not contain any TOPT control
  paragraph.

  The format of a TOPT control paragraph shall be:

    &lt;SOH&gt;"TOPT "&lt;point number&gt;&lt;CR&gt;

  where &lt;point number&gt; is the ASCII representation of the point number
  of the addressee. The point number shall be an unsigned integer in
  the range 1-65535.

  E.g. a message to point number 1 of a certain node shall contain the
  following TOPT control paragraph

    &lt;SOH&gt;"TOPT 1"&lt;CR&gt;

  Note that the format of a TOPT control paragraph deviates from the
  general format specified in separate FTSC documents in that it does
  not contain any colon after the control tag.


5. INTL
-------

  The INTL control paragraph shall be used to give information about
  the zone numbers of the original sender and the ultimate addressee
  of a message.

  The format of an INTL control paragraph shall be:

    &lt;SOH&gt;"INTL "&lt;destination address&gt;" "&lt;origin address&gt;&lt;CR&gt;

  where &lt;destination address&gt; shall be the representation of the
  address of ultimate destination and &lt;origin address&gt; is the
  representation of the address of the original sender of the message
  in question. These addresses shall be given on the form
  &lt;zone&gt;:&lt;net&gt;/&lt;node&gt; where &lt;zone&gt; is the ASCII representation of the
  zone number, &lt;net&gt; is the ASCII representation of the net number and
  &lt;node&gt; is the ASCII representation of the node number. Any point
  number information shall be given in FMPT and TOPT control
  paragraphs.

  E.g. a message from address 1:123/4.5 to 2:345/6.7 shall contain the
  following INTL control paragraph

    &lt;SOH&gt;"INTL 2:345/6 1:123/4"&lt;CR&gt;

  Note that the format of an INTL control paragraph deviates from the
  general format specified in separate FTSC documents in that it does
  not contain any colon after the control tag.

  INTL control paragraphs are also often used even when both the
  originating and the destination systems are in the same zone. This
  gives both the originating system and the destination system as well
  as any intermediate routing systems unambiguous zone information
  even in a situation where one system may be active in a number of
  different (possibly non-FidoNet) zones.

  Although it is known that some programs may route messages
  incorrectly if the INTL control paragraph is present in messages
  where both the originating and the destination systems are in the
  same zone, it is recommended that the INTL control paragraph is
  always inserted into netmail messages in packet files.
