                1. Format of product code list
                2. Application for a product code
----------------------------------------------------------------------


1. Format of product code list
------------------------------

  The FTSC publishes a list of all product codes issued. The filename
  is FTSCPROD.nnn, where nnn is a number which increases with each
  revision.

  The list is an ASCII text file with one line per product. Each line
  contains a number of fields, delimited by commas. Some fields may
  contain more than one value. In this case, the different values are
  delimited with a forward slash ('/'). Spaces in fields are replaced
  with underscores ('_'). Fields are not case-sensitive.

  These are the fields which are currently defined:

    code,name,platform,type,contact,netaddr[,assigned[,updated]]

  code      The product code. 4 digits hexadecimal.
  name      Product name.
  platform  Platforms(s) supported.
  type      Type(s) of product.
  contact   Name of contact person.
  netaddr   FidoNet address of contact person.
  assigned  Date the product code was originally assigned.
  updated   Date of last update of the product code data.

  Platforms
  ---------
  See the list for examples. (Will be specified more firmly later).

  Product types
  -------------
  Mailer    A mailer is a product that exchanges mail with FTS-0001,
            FTS-0006, EMSI or other protocols that include a product
            code field.
  Packer    A packer is a product that creates .PKT files.

  Dates
  -----
  The format is YYYYMMDD. A date field may also be blank.

  If you write software which is dependant on this format, please make
  it tolerant of additional fields after these for upwards
  compatibility.


2. Application for a product code
---------------------------------

  FidoNet products without an allocated product code which either
  create Type-2 packets, or negotiate FTS-0001 sessions must use a
  product code FEh (254d) in Type-2 compatible packet headers. This
  code as been reserved for that purpose (use by product without a
  product code). The product code FFh (255d) has been reserved to
  indicate that the product code is stored elsewhere in the packet
  header at an as yet unallocated offset.

  The FTSC is currently working on an update to the Type-2 packet
  specification, to allow 16-bit codes while keeping full backward
  compatibility with 8-bit codes (something which the current Type-2
  proposals in the FSC's are not). Until the specification is ready,
  16-bit codes are issued with the low byte set to FFh (255d).

  Below is an application form for an FTSC product code, which is used
  to identify your product when used in FidoNet, and providing a means
  by which you can be contacted should your product be found
  responsible for problems encountered during its use. The issuance of
  this product code in no way implies authorisation or approval of
  your product for use on the network, only provides a means of ready
  identification.

  This application should be completed and submitted for only `real'
  and completed products which will be used by FidoNet systems. If you
  are currently developing a product which is not yet ready for use on
  the network out of experimental stage, use product code 0 (zero)
  which is, by convention, reserved for this purpose.

  Please answer the questions as accurately and completely as
  possible. We need to know what will actually be used on the net, so
  describe only the current product, and leave future features and
  plans for the comments section.

  Send the completed form to the administrator of the FidoNet
  Technical Standards Committee. Please see FTA-1003 for addresses.

  We hope that you will take the time to revise your answers by
  submitting updates as your product changes. A summary of the
  information you provide is compiled into a list of all product codes
  published and updated periodically by the FTSC called
  "FTSCPROD.nnn".

FTSC Product Code Application
=============================

Type of application
-------------------

1.  Mark whichever is appropriate:

    ____  New product application
    ____  Update existing product       for existing product code ____


2.  If this is an update, please briefly state the nature of the
    update (change author's node number, change of product name, etc.)

Product information
-------------------

3.  What is the name of the product and the current version name or
    number?

    __________________________________________________________________


4.  What is the name, FidoNet node, and postal address, and voice
    number of the person(s) or organization responsible for the
    product?  Where should inquiries be directed and who should be
    contacted if the product is thought to cause errors on the
    network?

    __________________________________________________________________

    __________________________________________________________________
    __________________________________________________________________


5.  What operating systems does it currently run on?

    __________________________________________________________________


6.  Does the product contain a 'mailer'?  E.g. the package transmits
    mail to other FidoNet systems and can fall back to FTS-0001,
    though it may handle other protocols.

    __________________________________________________________________


7.  If the answer to question (6) is yes, what additional protocols
    other than FTS-0001 does the product support? Refer to the
    specific FTSC document which details this protocol, if any.

    __________________________________________________________________
    __________________________________________________________________
    __________________________________________________________________


    With what additions or restrictions?

    __________________________________________________________________


8.  Is the package capable of servicing file requests, and if so,
    'Bark' style (FTS-0008) and/or WaZOO .REQ (FTS-0006) or both?

    __________________________________________________________________


    With what additions or restrictions?

    __________________________________________________________________


9.  Is your software capable of functioning as a Continuous Mail
    system? i.e. nodes running it might be marked as such in the
    FidoNet nodelist?

    __________________________________________________________________


10. How is the product distributed?

    Public Domain  ____________          Shareware      ______________
    Commercial     ____________          Other          ______________
    Object code    ____________          Source code    ______________

    Comments: ________________________________________________________
    __________________________________________________________________
    __________________________________________________________________


11. Please give additional comments to describe your product.

  The application form was inspired by one originally published in
  FSC-0022 and later FSC-0090, originally by Bob Hartman, Jim Long,
  and Randy Bush and modified by Rick Moore and David Nugent.


C. History
----------

  Rev.1, 19970407: First non-draft release. Author Adrian Walker.
  Rev.2, 19971229: Author changed to Administrator. Reformatted
                   document slightly. Changed all dates in the lists
                   to 4 digit centuries. Added information about
                   status of 16-bit product codes.
  Rev.3, 19980322: Moved the product code list out of the document and
                   into a separate list, FTSCPROD.nnn. Added an
                   application form. Revised text about 16 bit codes.
