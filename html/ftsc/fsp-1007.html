Status of this document
-----------------------

  This document is a Fidonet Standards Proposal (FSP).

  This document specifies an optional Fidonet standard protocol for
  the Fidonet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
  improvements.

  This document is released to the public domain, and may be used,
  copied or modified for any purpose whatever.


Abstract
--------

  Private messages within FidoNet only have one recipient address.
  Multiple copies of the same message have to be sent to a FidoNet-
  to-Internet gateway in order to address multiple recipients. This is
  a proposal to indicate the addresses of multiple recipients in the
  body of the message sent to the gateway.


1. Scope
--------

  This standard is specified for FTN netmail messages sent to a
  FidoNet-to-Internet gateway. Users are able to add this information
  manually, although message editors could support this and make it
  transparent to the user.


2. Background
-------------

  Three types of recipient addresses can be specified on the Internet
  and are reflected in this suggestion: To, Cc and Bcc. "To" are the
  primary recipient(s) of the message. "Cc" is short for Carbon Copy
  and lists the recipients that are intended to receive the message as
  "informational". The last option "Bcc" is short for Blind Carbon
  Copy. Recipients lists as Bcc recipients will not show up in the
  headers of the Internet message, but get a copy anyway.


3. Format
---------

  Immediately following the kludge lines, one or more of the following
  lines can be inserted in the message. If a To: line is present, then
  these lines follow the To: line.

  GW-To: <e-mail address>[,<e-mail address>[...]]
  GW-Cc: <e-mail address>[,<e-mail address>[...]]
  GW-Bcc: <e-mail address>[,<e-mail address>[...]]

  Where <e-mail address> is in the form of

     ramon@wsd.wline.se
  or
     wsd.wline.se!ramon

  Multiple addresses can be specified on the same line, separated by a
  comma with optionally spaces around the comma. There is no limit
  regarding the length of the line. The line must be terminated by a
  single carriage return.

  The GW-To: line replaces the To: lines.

  The reason for GW-Cc is that "Cc:" by itself is expanded by some
  editors and used to generate multiple copies of a message.


4. Implementation notes for gateways
------------------------------------

  Gateways supporting this format add the e-mail addresses mentioned
  in any of these three headers to the envelope file and create on
  outbound (probably UUCP or SMTP) body text message. Rules for the
  maximum length of envelope files (if any) apply.

  The headers section of the RFC822 message will list the e-mail
  addresses under the To: and Cc: headers. A Bcc: header must not be
  added!
