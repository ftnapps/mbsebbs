<H1>Semafore files with MBSE BBS.</H1>

The directory $MBSE_ROOT/sema is the hardcoded semafore directory where all
semafore's must be created, tested and removed. When the system is booting,
the init script will erase all semafore's just before the BBS is started.
This description is valid from MBSE BBS v0.33.18 and newer.
