<H1>How to setup an FTP server to work with MBSE BBS.</H1>
<P>

In order to let MBSE BBS and your FTP server to both function together you must
organize a special file structure. Note that even if you don't setup an FTP
server you must still create a structure like this for the fidonet mailer,
if you don't, <strong>mail and files will get lost!</strong>
Note that this description is written for wu-ftpd, on your distribution there
may be another ftpd installed. <font color=red><u>Don't use mbftpd yet!</u></font>
<P>
<H4>The filestructure I used is as follows:</H4>
<PRE>
/var/spool/mbse/ftp/pub/dos_util/dos_4dos	- Public download areas
               |   |   |        /dos_disk
               |   |   |        /dos_file
               |   |   /virnet/mcafee
               |   |          /win16
               |   |          /win32
               |   /bin				- FTP bin directory
               |   /etc				- FTP etc directory
               |   /incoming			- FTP public upload.
               /mail/out			- Your default outbound
               |    /out.009			- Outbound Zone 9
               |    /inbound			- Inbound directory
               /raonly/upload			- Non-public download areas
               |      /sysop
               |      /logfiles
               /tic_queue			- Queue for .tic files.

</PRE>

In order to give DOS style names for fidonet sessions you must set the
DOS path and Unix path in <strong>mbsetup</strong> (1.3.11 and 1.3.12) to 
<strong>"m:"</strong> and <strong>"/var/spool/mbse"</strong>. Note that to get 
forwarding of .tic files to work the <strong>tic_queue</strong> must be a
subdirectory of "/var/spool/mbse" too. You could actually use any drive letter for
the DOS path.
<P>
This means that a fidonet file attach from the dos_4dos public download 
directory shall get the subject "M:\FTP\PUB\DOS_UTIL\DOS_4DOS\COMMAND.ZIP".

<P>
As you can see, anonymous ftp users can't get to the mail, non-public
downloads etc. Normally, your BBS users have unix accounts and will be able
to do a ftp login and access any directory on your system. Because the bbs
users have <b>mbsebbs</b> as their shell and this shell is not in the file
<b>/etc/shells</b> the ftp daemon will not let the bbs users in. So even
your own bbs users must login as anonymous to get files from the ftp server.
<P>
Note the following directory permissions MUST BE SET!!!!::: See also
the man pages for the DARPA ftpd server.
<P>

<PRE>
Directory               	owner group mode perms
------------------------------- ----- ----- ---- ----------
/var/spool/mbse			mbse  bbs   0755 drwxr-xr-x
/var/spool/mbse/ftp		root  wheel 0555 dr-xr-xr-x
/var/spool/mbse/ftp/bin		root  wheel 0555 dr-xr-xr-x
/var/spool/mbse/ftp/bin/ls	root  bin   0111 ---x--x--x
/var/spool/mbse/ftp/etc		root  root  0555 dr-xr-xr-x
/var/spool/mbse/ftp/etc/passwd	root  root  0444 -r--r--r--
/var/spool/mbse/ftp/etc/group	root  root  0444 -r--r--r--
/var/spool/mbse/ftp/pub		mbse  bbs   0775 drwxrwxr-x
/var/spool/mbse/ftp/incoming   	ftp   users 0755 drwxr-xr-x

</PRE>
Note that all subdirectories under ../pub also must be owned by <strong>mbse
</strong> and group <strong>bbs</strong> and have at least mode 775 as long 
as it are real bbs subdirectories. The bbs will maintain these directories 
automatic and must have the rights to do so.

<P>
In the /var/spool/mbse/ftp/etc/group file, add the group bbs so that your directory
listings give the proper groupname instead of a number.
